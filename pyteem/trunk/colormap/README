So, this didn't get implemented as an app, but the histo, smile, and isocontour projects all include colormapping code, so it shoudln't be hard to to create... 

The main reason this never got implemented was because I was looking for some way to allow users an interface for specifying colormaps directly in the program... I was imagining something like the layer-manager in photoshop which contained blocks (with index and color fields) which would order themselves properly based on index. I looked into this and the only things I could find for displaying lists of items were QListView and QListWidget, which are used for displaying lists of files and such things... There is no way to use these to display a list of custom widgets (hboxLayout with containing 2 QLineEdit fields) and order them according to some property... You'd have to code a custom widget to handle that, which I just didn't have time to do so I abandoned it... It might be something that given time would be good to come back and implement (it would be really nice to have / incorporate into student projects)...
