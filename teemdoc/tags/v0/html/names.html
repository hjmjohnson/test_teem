<p>

The names of my libraries may seem somewhat odd, so their origin
should be explained.  In general, I don't think that acronyms usually
make good names for software.  Either they are spelled out instead of
just spoken, or they are clever contrivances nervously posing as words.
I do admit to full acronym guilt with respect to <b>nrrd</b> and
<b>unrrdu</b>.  Since then, however, I've stuck to using actual words
for my software names.

<p>

Imagine: <u>words</u>!  The way some people
name their software, you'd think we were in the middle of some sort of
word drought.  In fact, there are many words.  As names for software,
words have two under-appreciated benefits, both related to what it
means to be a word:
<ul>
<li> established pronunciation
<li> established meaning
</ul>

A word may have more than one pronunciation or meaning, but that's
probably a lot better than <b>zero</b>.  <!-- If you want to create
names from <a
href="http://www.alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxwholec.html">whole
cloth</a>, you should probably leave that to the pros who come up with
names for drugs (and these days, cars). -->

<p>

This is the 21st century.  I encourage you to name your next software
project with a word.  And remember: there are lots of verbs and
adjectives out there, too, not just nouns.
