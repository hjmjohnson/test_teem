<h2>Nearly Raw Raster Data</h2>

<tt><b>nrrd</b></tt> is a library for reading, writing, slicing, dicing,
projecting, permuting, shuffling, converting, quantizing,
histograming, resampling, and otherwise manipulating N-dimensional
raster data of any scalar type.  The default file format is simple: human
readable ASCII header, followed by raw binary data; other formats
(such as ASCII data) are possible.  Also, <tt><b>nrrd</b></tt> recognizes and
generates raw and ascii PNM images (PPM color and PGM grayscale).
Finally, reading data from existing non-nrrd files is
facilitated through the use of detached headers (header and data in
seperate files), and the ability to locate the start of data at an
arbitrary position in a file (so as to skip past another format's
ascii or binary header).

<p>

Most of the motivation for writing <tt><b>nrrd</b></tt> came from an
observation while doing my Master's thesis research: 99.9% of the
time, the data that I care about is raster data; whether it be a 3-D
scalar volume, a 3-D histogram volume, a 2-D image, a 2-D transfer
function, a 1-D histogram, etc.  It would be silly to not have a
simple way of unifying these representations, for all dimensions, for
all the various C basic types, with all the mathematically sensible
ways of changing between dimensions, and with the ability to view the
data as a PNM image whenever possible.  <tt><b>nrrd</b></tt> was
actually the first <tt><b>teem</b></tt> library written (started in
1998), <a href="../air/"><tt><b>air</b></tt></a> and <a
href="../biff/"><tt><b>biff</b></tt></a> grew out of it.  Since then,
4-D nrrds have been for representing tensor fields, and 5-D nrrds for
time-varying vector fields.

<p>

Stark simplicity is the main principle of <tt><b>nrrd</b></tt>. The
goal of <tt><b>nrrd</b></tt> is <em>not</em> to introduce any layers
of abstraction between the programmer and the numerical data resident
in the computer's memory.  Rather, the point is to create the thinnest
and most simplistic possible interface to the raw raster data itself.
For instance, it assumes that the programmer is comfortable with
thinking about arrays as being simultaneously multi-dimensional in
logical structure while strictly uni-dimensional in memory layout.
This comes fairly easily to people who have spent significant time
manipulating and processing data in "raw" form, or who, when faced
with getting data to and from a disk, think first <tt>fread()</tt> and
<tt>fwrite()</tt>.

<p>

Essentially, <tt><b>nrrd</b></tt> is a toolbox for making the manipulation of
raw data more convenient for those programmers who are comfortable
thinking at that low level of representation, or for those procedures
or algorithms which logically operate at that level.  While there are
a few parts of <tt><b>nrrd</b></tt> which smack of C++ templates,
<tt><b>nrrd</b></tt> is written in vanilla ANSI C.  The basic unit of the
<tt><b>nrrd</b></tt> library is the <tt>Nrrd</tt> struct, which is little
more than a thin wrapper around a "<tt>void&nbsp;*</tt>" pointing to
the underlying raw array in memory.  The wrapper holds information
such as the type, dimension, axis lengths and limits, and comments.
With time, the "thin" wrapper has gotten somewhat thicker, but I
believe that I've nearly converged on the feature set that
<tt><b>nrrd</b></tt> will support.

<p>

In the context of other software which deals with raster data,
<tt><b>nrrd</b></tt>'s most likely role is that of a <b>pre-processing
engine</b>, in which some visualization/analysis/segmentation needs
the raster data in a certain type/size/dimension/order which doesn't
quite match the available data.  Ideally, instead of writing a one-off
program or perl or IDL script for this kind of data hacking,
<tt><b>nrrd</b></tt> can be employed.

<p>

In more detail, the <tt><b>nrrd</b></tt> functionality includes:
<ul>
<li><b>Cropping + Padding</b>: Select some subset or superset of the
original data, allowing either padding or flooding at the boundaries.

<li><b>Slicing + Stitching/Joining</b>: cut an (N-1)-D array
from a N-D one by slicing at some position along some axis,
or stitch many such slices back into an N-D array, or join
many small N-D slabs into a larger volume.

<li><b>Blurring, Filtering, or other Resampling</b>: This allows
high-quality resampling of data (both up- and down-sampling) using an
interpolating kernel, as well as resampling with non-interpolating
kernels (such a Gaussian).  Limited forms of median filtering also are
supported.

<li><b>Quantizing</b>: easy ways of going from a floating point array
to an integral representation, using either 8, 16, or 32 bits.  If
floating point values between 0.0 and 10.0 are quantized, the
<tt><b>nrrd</b></tt> struct can remember that the original value range was
0.0 to 10.0.

<li><b>Converting</b>: changing between different scalar types
(changing an array of <tt>int</tt>s into one of <tt>float</tt>s,
using the exact same semantics as C assignment and casting.

<li><b>Axis Permutation</b>: When a N-D array is arranged linearly in
memory, there is some ordering to the different axis according to how
"fast" their coordinates change.  That axis ordering can be
arbitrarily rearranged.

<li><b>Shuffling</b>: The slices along one axis can be re-ordered

<li><b>Histograms</b>: I often think of data in terms of its histogram,
so generating histograms of different types is basic in <tt><b>nrrd</b></tt>.
There are actually four kinds of histograming operations:
<ul>
<li>Simple histograming: view the data as a big 1-D array, make a new
1-D array which is its histogram
<li>Histogram drawing: make an informative picture of a 1-D histogram
<li>Axis histograming: An N-D array can be viewed as an (N-1)-D array
of 1-D scanlines, along some chosen axis.  Axis histograming replaces
each 1-D scanline with its histogram.
<li>Multi-histograming: Generalizes simple histogramming to M dimensions:
given M nrrds of equal size, generate an M-D histogram in which
each bin records the number of the intercombinations of values between the 
input <tt><b>nrrd</b></tt> implied by the bin coordinates.
</ul>

<li><b>Projections ("Measures")</b>: An N-D array can be reduced to an
(N-1)-D array by replacing every scanline along some direction with a
single scalar value.  This process is called a "measure" in
<tt><b>nrrd</b></tt>, and currently supported measures include min, max, sum,
product, mean, median, mode, L1, L2, Linf, and variance.

<li><b>PNM image</b>: PNM images are recognized as nrrds, and
nrrds can be saved as PGM or PPM image when appropriate.

</ul>
