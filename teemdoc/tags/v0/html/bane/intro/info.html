<tt><b>bane</b></tt>/<tt><b>gkms</b></tt> tutorial: Step 3:
Distilling the Histogram Volume</h2>

<blockquote>

As with the other <tt>gkms</tt> commands, you get usage info for
distilling histogram volumes by supplying no arguments, and invoking
just "gkms info":
<blockquote><pre>
usage: bin/gkms info [-d 1|2] [-m &lt;measr&gt;] &lt;input&gt; &lt;output&gt;
Default values are in {}s
    -d 1|2 : dimension of histo-info to be created
             {1}
  -m measr : how to collapse axes of the histogram volume
             "mean": average (as done in GK's published research)
             "median": value at 50% percentile
             "mode": most common value
             {mean}
     input : histogram volume being analyzed
    output : histo-info to be created
</pre></blockquote>

<p>

There are not too many parameters here.  The dimension of the info
file is determined by the dimensionality of the opacity function you
want to create.  The default ("-d 1") is good if you're working with
plain one-dimensional opacity functions ...

<blockquote><pre>
gkms info engine-hvol.nrrd engine-info1.nrrd
</pre></blockquote>

... or the "-d 2" is for when you're interested in exploring the power
of two-dimensional transfer functions ...

<blockquote><pre>
gkms info -d 2 engine-hvol.nrrd engine-info2.nrrd
</pre></blockquote>

<p>

The "info" files generated by this step are arrays of floating point
numbers which summarize important aspects of the histogram volume.
Specifically, the 1-dimensional "info" files contain essentially g(v)
and h(v), and the 2-dimensional "info" file contains essentially
h(v,g). See <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~gk/MS/html/node18.html">
this section</a> of my MS thesis for definitions of these functions.
One dimensional opacity functions are simple and familiar, but for
many measured datasets the expressive power of two dimensional opacity
functions facilitates a much higher level of control over which
boundaries are rendered, and how.

<p>

There isn't any visual feedback for these programs, so there aren't
any pictures to put on this page.  Chances are, once you've generated
the info files, you can delete the histogram volume, since it isn't
used by any other <tt>gkms</tt> commands.

<p>

The "measr" parameter is not one which I've described in any of my
published work, but which can be useful for analyzing histogram
volumes from some more complicated datasets.  ... More information as
time permits ...
