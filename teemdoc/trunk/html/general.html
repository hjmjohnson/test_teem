<h3>Library inter-dependencies</h3>

<a href="img/teem-graph.png"><img align=right padding=10 src="img/_teem-graph.png" border=0></a>
The inter-dependencies of the Teem libraries has slowly converged
according a notion of what functionality is "fundamental" versus
"specialized".  This is not a clear-cut distinction, but the present
arrangement has proven successful.  It is graphed <a
href="img/teem-graph.png">here</a>, with the fundamental libraries at
the bottom, and the more specialized libraries on top. The Air
library depends on no other library (besides the system's math
library).  Libraries like Mite depend on nearly every other library,
because of the integration of tasks it represents.

<h3>Naming and C namespace considerations</h3>

Teem is careful to minimize the chances of namespace
clashes with other existing libraries, and is very consistent in how
parts elements in the library are named.   All the Teem source
complies fully with the policies described here.

<p>

The library names in Teem are mostly words, and considerable
effort is made to find library names that are both meaningful, yet not
already used in use as library names (as determined by <a
href="http://www.google.com">google</a> searches).  The library
names are <a href="names.html">explained elsewhere</a>.

<p>

Every library has a primary header file with the same name as the
library.  Air has <tt>air.h</tt>, Hest has
<tt>hest.h</tt>, and so forth.  Libraries may have additional header
files; Nrrd has <tt>nrrd.h</tt>, <tt>nrrdDefines.h</tt>,
<tt>nrrdEnums.h</tt>, and <tt>nrrdMacros.h</tt>.  However, the only
header file which needs to be explicitly <tt>#include</tt>d in other
source files is the primary header file (such as
<tt>air.h</tt> or <tt>nrrd.h</tt>).  The Teem directory structure
is set up so that these header files are themselves in a subdirectory
of "<tt>include</tt>" called "<tt>teem</tt>", so that including 
Teem headers in other headers is apt to look something like this
(taken from <tt>hoover.h</tt>):

<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;

#include &lt;teem/air.h&gt;
#include &lt;teem/biff.h&gt;
#include &lt;teem/ell.h&gt;
#include &lt;teem/nrrd.h&gt;
#include &lt;teem/limn.h&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

Any <tt>#define</tt>s within the library headers will start with
either the library name (in upper case), or an underscore followed by
the library name.  For instance, <tt>air.h</tt> defines a macro called
<tt>AIR_INDEX</tt>, and <tt>nrrdDefines.h</tt> defines an integer
<tt>NRRD_DIM_MAX</tt>.

<p>

Every symbol (functions, global variables, and enum values) in a
Teem library starts with the library name (in lower case), or
one or more understores followed by the library name.  For example,
the Nrrd library supplies functions named <tt>nrrdNew</tt>,
<tt>nrrdCopy</tt>, and <tt>nrrdNuke</tt>, as well as global variables
<tt>nrrdDefSpacing</tt> and <tt>nrrdStateVerboseIO</tt>, and 
enum value names starting with <tt>nrrdFormat</tt>, <tt>nrrdEncoding</tt>,
and <tt>nrrdType</tt>.

<h3>Function return values</h3>

Nearly all Teem functions return either an <tt>int</tt> or a
pointer.  The ones that return pointers are pseudo-constructors or
pseudo-destructors.  The <tt>int</tt> return values are interpreted as
an error value: zero means "no error, everything ran okay", and
non-zero means "there were problems".  This means that code to check
for errors will generally look like:

<blockquote><pre>
if (teemFunction(arg1, arg2)) {
  do error handling;
  return 1;
}
/* else no problem ... */
</pre></blockquote>

In general, I am not a big believer in returning different integral error
codes to indicate different kinds of errors.  These are often
frustrating because they tell a little bit about what happened, but
don't tell you everything that might be helpful in isolating and
fixing the problem.  Rather, I accumulate textual descriptions (in
English) of the errors in the <a
href="biff/index.html">Biff</a> library.  For instance, in
<tt>nrrdSwapAxes()</tt>, we find:

<blockquote><pre>
if (nrrdPermuteAxes(nout, nin, axes)) {
  sprintf(err, "%s: trouble swapping axes", me);
  biffAdd(NRRD, err); return 1;
}
</pre></blockquote>

The use of <tt>biffAdd()</tt> insures that the current error string is
added to list of previous errors, with the assumption that
<tt>nrrdPermuteAxes()</tt> also left some errors with Biff.
This allows you to see the call stack at the time of the error,
with each function giving contextual information (if any) describing
what it was trying to do.  Here's an example of a nrrd read failing
for the <tt>unu</tt> program:
<blockquote><pre>
unu minmax: error parsing "vol.nhdr" as nrrd for <nin> option:
[nrrd] nrrdLoad:
[nrrd] nrrdRead: trouble reading NRRD file
[nrrd] _nrrdReadNrrd:
[nrrd] _nrrdReadDataRaw: fread() got only 262144 4-byte things, not 266240
</pre></blockquote>

See the <a href="biff/index.html">Biff page</a> for more specific 
information on Biff usage.
