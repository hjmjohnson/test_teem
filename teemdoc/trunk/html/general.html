<h3>THIS IS UNFINISHED</h3>

The inter-dependencies of the <b>teem</b> libraries has slowly
converged according to my notion of what functionality is
"fundamental" versus "specialized".  This is not a clear-cut
distinction, but the present arrangement has proven successful.
It is graphed here:
<center>
<img width=409 height=306 src="img/teemmap.png"
alt="teem lib dependency graph">
</center>
<b>air</b> is at the top because it depends on no other library
(besides the system's math library).  Each edge represents a
dependency, either from using data or functions provided by the higher
library, or from requiring a data structure definition or
<tt>#define</tt> from its header file.  Going from top to bottom, the
libraries appear in exactly the same order that they are built.

<ul>

<li><b>Names of things</b>: Every library has a header (.h) file with
the same name as the library.  <b>air</b> has <tt>air.h</tt>, and so
forth.  Libraries may have additional header files; <b>nrrd</b> has
both <tt>nrrd.h</tt> and <tt>nrrdDefines.h</tt>.  However, the only
header file which needs to be explicitly <tt>#include</tt>d in other
source code using the library is the primary header file (such as
<tt>air.h</tt> or <tt>nrrd.h</tt>).  Within those header files, there
will be some <tt>#define</tt>s; every one of them starts with the
library name in upper case, followed by an underscore.  For instance,
<tt>air.h</tt> defines a macro called <tt>AIR_INDEX</tt> for
generating linear array indices from floating point numbers.

<p>

Every symbol (function, global variable) in a library starts with a
fixed "symbol prefix", or some number of underscores followed by the
"symbol prefix".  Currently, (for <b>air</b>, <b>biff</b>,
<b>nrrd</b>, <b>bane</b>, and <b>limn</b>), the symbol prefix is
identical to the library name.  For instance, all "public"
<b>nrrd</b> function names start with <b>nrrd</b>.  There may be a
library in the future with a shortened version of the library as the
symbol prefix.

</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Return codes</b>: Nearly all functions in <b>teem</b> return
an <tt>int</tt>.  This value is the error code; it is non-zero when
there has been an error.  This means that code to check for errors 
will generally look like:
<blockquote><pre>
if (teemFunction(arg1, arg2)) {
  do error handling;
  return 1;
}
/* else no problem ... */
</pre></blockquote>


Were I to get fancy, the exacty value would be some indicator of what
sort of error happened.  This practice has not been adopted.  For the
most part, textual descriptions (in English) of the errors accumulate
with <a href="biff/index.html"><b>biff</b></a>.  For instance, in
<tt>nrrdSwapAxes()</tt>, we find the code

<blockquote><pre>
if (nrrdPermuteAxes(nout, nin, axes)) {
  sprintf(err, "%s: trouble swapping axes", me);
  biffAdd(NRRD, err); return 1;
}
</pre></blockquote>

The use of <tt>biffAdd()</tt> insures that the current error string is
added to list of previous errors, with the assumption that
<tt>nrrdPermuteAxes()</tt> also left some errors with <b>biff</b>.
See the <a href="biff/index.html"><b>biff</b> page</a> for more specific 
information on <b>biff</b> usage.

<p>

Exceptions to the above are functions which have "Valid" in their
name, like <tt>baneValidHVol</tt>, as well as some other functions
like <tt>nrrdFitsInFormat</tt>.  These should be read more as
predicates in a logical statement, not as function calls.  So,
<tt>baneValidHVol(hvol)</tt> returns non-zero when <tt>hvol</tt>
<b>is</b> as valid histogram volume, and it returns zero when
<tt>hvol</tt> is <b>not</b> a valid histogram volume.  Code might look
like:

<blockquote><pre>
if (!baneValidHVol(hvol)) {
  sprintf(err, "%s: given nrrd isn't a histogram volume", me);
  biffAdd(BANE, err); return 1;
}
/* else no problem ... */
</pre></blockquote>

</ul>
