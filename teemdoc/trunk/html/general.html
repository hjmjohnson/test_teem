<h3>Library inter-dependencies</h3>

The inter-dependencies of the <b>teem</b> libraries has slowly
converged according to my notion of what functionality is
"fundamental" versus "specialized".  This is not a clear-cut
distinction, but the present arrangement has proven successful.
It is graphed here, with the fundamental stuff at the top left,
and the specialized stuff at the bottom right:
<blockquote>

alt="teem lib dependency graph">
</center>
</blockquote>
<b>air</b> is at the top because it depends on no other library
(besides the system's math library).  <b>ten</b> is at the bottom
because, being my PhD work, it depends on nearly all the other
software I've written.  Each edge represents a
dependency, either from using data or functions provided by the higher
library, or from requiring a data structure definition or
<tt>#define</tt> from its header file.  The edges are colored
according to the library being depeneded upon.  For visual clarity,
edges are drawn both above and below the diagonal, but this doesn't
signify anything in itself.  Also, this only shows the immediate
dependencies and not their recursive expansion (<b>ten</b> depends on
<b>limn</b> depends on <b>hest</b>, but there is no edge from
<b>ten</b> to <b>hest</b>). Going from top to bottom, the libraries
appear in exactly the same order that they are built.

<h3>Naming and C namespace considerations</h3>

<b>Teem</b> is extremely careful to minimize the chances of namespace
clashes with other existing libraries, and is very consistent in how
parts elements in the library are named.   All the <b>teem</b> source
complies fully with the policies described here.

<p>

The library names in <b>teem</b> are mostly words, and I go to great
lengths to find library names that are both meaningful, yet not
already used as library names (as determined by <a
href="http://www.google.com">google</a> searches).  The library
names are <a href="names.html">explained elsewhere</a>.

<p>

Every library has a primary header file with the same name as the
library.  <b>air</b> has <tt>air.h</tt>, <b>hest</b> has
<tt>hest.h</tt>, and so forth.  Libraries may have additional header
files; <b>nrrd</b> has <tt>nrrd.h</tt>, <tt>nrrdDefines.h</tt>,
<tt>nrrdEnums.h</tt>, and <tt>nrrdMacros.h</tt>.  However, the only
header file which needs to be explicitly <tt>#include</tt>d in other
source files is the primary header file (such as
<tt>air.h</tt> or <tt>nrrd.h</tt>).  The <b>teem</b> directory structure
is set up so that these header files are themselves in a subdirectory
of "<tt>include</tt>" called "<tt>teem</tt>", so that including 
<b>teem</b> headers in other headers is apt to look something like this
(taken from <tt>hoover.h</tt>):

<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;

#include &lt;teem/air.h&gt;
#include &lt;teem/biff.h&gt;
#include &lt;teem/ell.h&gt;
#include &lt;teem/nrrd.h&gt;
#include &lt;teem/limn.h&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

Any <tt>#define</tt>s within the library headers will start with
either the library name (in upper case), or an underscore followed by
the library name.  For instance, <tt>air.h</tt> defines a macro called
<tt>AIR_INDEX</tt>, and <tt>nrrdDefines.h</tt> defines an integer
<tt>NRRD_DIM_MAX</tt>.

<p>

Every symbol (functions, global variables, and enum values) in a
<b>teem</b> library starts with the library name (in lower case), or
one or more understores followed by the library name.  For example,
the <b>nrrd</b> library supplies functions named <tt>nrrdNew</tt>,
<tt>nrrdCopy</tt>, and <tt>nrrdNuke</tt>, as well as global variables
<tt>nrrdDefSpacing</tt> and <tt>nrrdStateVerboseIO</tt>, and 
enum value names starting with <tt>nrrdFormat</tt>, <tt>nrrdEncoding</tt>,
and <tt>nrrdType</tt>.

<h3>Function return values</h3>

Nearly all <b>teem</b> functions return either an <tt>int</tt> or a
pointer.  The ones that return pointers are pseudo-constructors or
pseudo-destructors.  The <tt>int</tt> return values are interpreted as
an error value: zero means "no error, everything ran okay", and
non-zero means "there were problems".  This means that code to check
for errors will generally look like:

<blockquote><pre>
if (teemFunction(arg1, arg2)) {
  do error handling;
  return 1;
}
/* else no problem ... */
</pre></blockquote>

In general, I am not a big believer in returning different integral error
codes to indicate different kinds of errors.  These are often
frustrating because they tell a little bit about what happened, but
don't tell you everything that might be helpful in isolating and
fixing the problem.  Rather, I accumulate textual descriptions (in
English) of the errors in the <a
href="biff/index.html"><b>biff</b></a> library.  For instance, in
<tt>nrrdSwapAxes()</tt>, we find:

<blockquote><pre>
if (nrrdPermuteAxes(nout, nin, axes)) {
  sprintf(err, "%s: trouble swapping axes", me);
  biffAdd(NRRD, err); return 1;
}
</pre></blockquote>

The use of <tt>biffAdd()</tt> insures that the current error string is
added to list of previous errors, with the assumption that
<tt>nrrdPermuteAxes()</tt> also left some errors with <b>biff</b>.
This allows you to see the call stack at the time of the error,
with each function giving contextual information (if any) describing
what it was trying to do.  Here's an example of a nrrd read failing
for the <tt>unu</tt> program:
<blockquote><pre>
unu minmax: error parsing "vol.nhdr" as nrrd for <nin> option:
[nrrd] nrrdLoad:
[nrrd] nrrdRead: trouble reading NRRD file
[nrrd] _nrrdReadNrrd:
[nrrd] _nrrdReadDataRaw: fread() got only 262144 4-byte things, not 266240
</pre></blockquote>

See the <a href="biff/index.html"><b>biff</b> page</a> for more specific 
information on <b>biff</b> usage.
