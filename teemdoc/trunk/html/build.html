<h2>CMake</h2>

The best way to build Teem is with <a
href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a>, including the 
curses (terminal) interface <tt>ccmake</tt>. Pre-compiled binaries of CMake
<a href="http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Download.html">are available</a>.
CMake allows Teem to be built for any platform, including Windows,
with relative ease, and provides the best control over shared
libraries, external dependencies, and so forth.

<p>

To build Teem with <tt>ccmake</tt>:

<ul>

  <li> Go to a directory where the "teem" source subdirectory should be
  created.
  <li> <tt>svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/teem/code/teem/trunk teem</tt>
  <li> Make a directory for all the built object files and libraries:<br>
  <tt>mkdir teem-build</tt>
  <li> <tt>cd teem-build</tt>
  <li> <tt>ccmake ../teem</tt> (or wherever the Teem source is)
  <li> Type "c".  Cmake chews on a bunch of stuff, saying "Configuring ..."
  <li> You get a screen of options to edit.  Use the up and down arrows to
  go between them. Hit return to begin and end editing text fields, and to
  toggle the binary ON/OFF fields.  Be careful when editing text fields:
  there's unfortunately no clear visual indication of whether you are or
  aren't editing the field.
  <li> If you want to install the binaries and libraries somewhere, set
  that directory as <tt>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</tt>.  In that directory
  will be created subdirectories <tt>bin</tt>, <tt>include</tt>, and
  <tt>lib</tt>.
  <li> Turn ON "BUILD_SHARED_LIBS" if you want to created shared libraries
  or DLLs, and leave ON the other formats and encodings you want at the bottom.
  <li> Type "c" again, then "g", which causes cmake to generate the Makefile
  and quit.
  <li> <tt>make</tt>
  <li> <tt>make install</tt> (if you want)

</ul>


<p>

The information below refers to a home-grown system of GNUMakefiles
which is no longer supported.

<h3>Windows users (except Cygwin): <a href="windows.html">Go here</a></h3>

<h3>The basic steps</h3>

To build <b>teem</b> you will need <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">GNU make</a>.  I am
in fact using many GNU-make-specific features, and all my makefiles
are actually named <tt>GNUmakefile</tt> instead of <tt>Makefile</tt>
to minimize the chances of someone trying to use a non-GNU make.

<ol>

<li> <a href="download/index.html">Download</a> the <b>teem</b>
distribution

<li> Untar it.<br>
Throughout this and all other <b>teem</b> documentation, the directory
just created will be referred to as "<tt>teem</tt>", even though it
will actually be called "<tt>teem-1.XblahN</tt>" or something similar.

<li> Go into this directory.

<li> Depending on what architecture you're on, set the <tt>TEEM_ARCH</tt>
environment variable (however you do that in your favorite shell) to
one of the following:

<ul>
<li><tt>linux.32</tt>: 32-bit GNU/Linux
<li><tt>linux.64</tt>: 64-bit GNU/Linux
<li><tt>cygwin</tt>: A Cygwin shell running on a Windows box
<li><tt>irix6.n32</tt>: 32-bit Irix
<li><tt>irix6.64</tt>: 64-bit Irix
<li><tt>solaris</tt>: Solaris machines running in 32-bit mode.
<li><tt>darwin.32</tt>: 32-bit Mac OS X.
<li><tt>darwin.64</tt>: 64-bit Mac OS X.
</ul>

<li> (Optional) If you want the teem headers, libraries, and
command-line tools to be installed in a particular location, you need
to set the <tt>TEEM_DEST</tt> environment variable to the directory
in which the <tt>include</tt>, <tt>lib</tt>, and <tt>bin</tt>
directories will be the final locations the teem files.

<li> <tt>cd src; make</tt><br>
This will build and "install" all the <b>teem</b> libraries, as well
as all the <a href="bin/index.html">command-line tools</a>.  Specifically,
assuming <tt>TEEM_DEST</tt> was not set:
<ul>
<li> All include files will be copied into <tt>teem/include/teem</tt>
<li> All libraries will be copied into <tt>teem/$TEEM_ARCH/lib</tt>
<li> All command-line tools be copied into <tt>teem/$TEEM_ARCH/bin</tt>
</ul>
If <tt>TEEM_DEST</tt> was set, these directories will be created if needed:
<ul>
<li> All include files will be copied into <tt>$TEEM_DEST/include/teem</tt>.
<li> All libraries will be copied into <tt>$TEEM_DEST/lib</tt>
<li> All command-line tools be copied into <tt>$TEEM_DEST/bin</tt>
</ul>

On a multi-processor machine,
building <tt>teem-1.5beta0</tt> or later, feel free to use
"<tt>make&nbsp;-j10</tt>" or similar to speed this up.

<li> <tt>cd ../$TEEM_ARCH/bin</tt> (or <tt>cd $TEEM_DEST/bin</tt>)

<li> <tt>./nrrdSanity</tt><br>

This little program calls a <b>nrrd</b> function called
<tt>nrrdSanity()</tt> which basically makes sure that everything
hard-coded (or set at compile-time) into <b>nrrd</b> is correct for
the machine you're on.  For instance, the various assumptions about
type sizes and representational ranges are checked, as is endianness,
and the availability of IEEE 754 floating point numbers.  If you get
anything besides:

<blockquote><pre>
./nrrdSanity: nrrd sanity check passed.
</pre></blockquote>

then your <b>teem</b> build will not work correctly.  Either one of
the default settings in the architecture-specific makefile
<tt>teem/src/make/&lt;arch&gt;.mk</tt> is wrong, or your machine isn't
up to snuff.  In either case, email me (gk@cs.utah.edu) with the error
message from <tt>nrrdSanity</tt>.

</ol>

<h3>Making a better teem: zlib, bzip2, png, and pthread</h3>

If you want <b>hoover</b> to be multi-threaded, or
if you want <b>nrrd</b> to support zlib/gzip or bzip2
compression, or allow <b>nrrd</b> to read and write PNG images, you
need to set additional environment variables, as well as have compiled
version of the associated libraries.  The following three variables
need simply to be set (as with "<tt>setenv&nbsp;TEEM_ZLIB</tt>" for
csh-style shells, or "<tt>export&nbsp;TEEM_ZLIB</tt>" for sh-style
shells), as
opposed to set to a specific string (as with
"<tt>setenv&nbsp;TEEM_ZLIB&nbsp;true</tt>"
or "<tt>export&nbsp;TEEM_ZLIB=true</tt>"):

<p>

<table border=1>

<tr>
<td><tt>TEEM_PTHREAD</tt><td> Allows <b>hoover</b> to run multiple
threads, so that hoover-based volume renderers are multi-threaded.

<tr>
<td><tt>TEEM_ZLIB</tt><td> Allows <b>nrrd</b> to read and write raw
data compressed with zlib compression, for instance with the "<tt>-e
gzip</tt>" encoding flag in <tt>unu save</tt>.  The compressed data is
compatible with the gzip and gunzip command-line tools.

<tr>
<td><tt>TEEM_BZIP2</tt><td> Allows <b>nrrd</b> to read and write raw
data compressed with bzip2, for instance with the "<tt>-e bzip2</tt>"
encoding flag in <tt>unu save</tt>. The compressed data is compatible
with the bzip2 and bunzip2 command-line tools.

<tr>
<td><tt>TEEM_PNG</tt><td> Allows <b>nrrd</b> to read and write PNG images,
for instance with the "<tt>-f png</tt>" format flag in <tt>unu save</tt>.
This requires <tt>TEEM_ZLIB</tt>.  

</table>

<p>

The following versions of the optional libraries are recommended:
<ul>
<li> zlib: 1.1.4
<li> bzip2: 1.0.2
<li> libpng: 1.0.12
</ul>
Note that on GNU/Linux you may have to get the "development" version of
the package ("<tt>...-dev</tt>") in order to get the headers and libraries,
instead of just the associated command-line tools and their documentation.

<p>

In case you do not have the workable versions of zlib, bzip2, and png
installed in <tt>/usr/local/</tt> on your system (or wherever the C
compiler looks for headers and libraries by default), you can teach
the teem makefiles where to find them by setting yet more environment
variables.  In the following, "<tt>XXX</tt>" stands for either
"<tt>ZLIB</tt>", "<tt>BZIP2</tt>", or "<tt>PNG</tt>".

<table border=1>

<tr>
<td><tt>TEEM_XXX_IPATH</tt> <td>This is the include flag to be passed
the compiler, to tell it where to find the header files for optional
thing <tt>XXX</tt>.  It should be of the form
"<tt>-I&lt;<i>path</i>&gt;</tt>", such as
"<tt>-I/home/gk/include</tt>".

<tr>
<td><tt>TEEM_XXX_LPATH</tt> <td>This is the link flag to be passed to
the linker, to tell it where to find the library for optional thing
<tt>XXX</tt>. It should be of the form "<tt>-L&lt;<i>path</i>&gt;</tt>",
such as "<tt>-L/home/gk/lib</tt>".  The makefiles know the name of
the library; you do not need to (nor can you) supply the library link
flag itself (e.g. "<tt>-lzlib</tt>"); this is done by the makefiles for you.
