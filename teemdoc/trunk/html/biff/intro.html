The vast majority of <b>teem</b> functions calls that do anything important
or substantial have an <tt>int</tt> return type.  This is a
Unix-system-call-style error code: it is zero if all is well, and non-zero
if there was a problem.  Because of laziness and simplicity, I have not
developed conventions for what different error codes mean, so <b>teem</b>
functions generally return 1 if something went wrong.  Functions record
details about exactly what went wrong by storing a text error message
in <b>biff</b>.

<p>

Every error message to <b>biff</b> is keyed with a small string identifying
what library or program is generating the error.  In <b>teem</b>, that
string is usually just the name of the library ("nrrd", "gage", etc.).  In
fact, the main header file for every <b>teem</b> library xxx has a
<tt>#define XXX</tt> which expands to "xxx".  This is intended to be used
as the <b>biff</b> key for any errors in that library.  A function at the
top of a deep call-stack will record information about what the error
condition was, and every other function down the stack can record
contextual information.

<p>

For example, if a call to <tt>nrrdLoad()</tt> failed (with return value 1)
because the header file refers to a non-existant data file, then the
messages in <b>biff</b> tell the sad story:

<blockquote><pre>
test/tread: couldn't open nrrd "engine-crop.nhdr":
[nrrd] nrrdLoad:
[nrrd] nrrdRead: trouble reading NRRD
[nrrd] _nrrdReadNrrd: trouble parsing data file info "./engine-crop.raw"
[nrrd] _nrrdReadNrrdParse_data_file: fopen("./engine-crop.raw","rb") failed: No such file or directory
</pre></blockquote>

The first line isn't actually from <b>biff</b>, its from the stand-alone
program which called <tt>nrrdLoad()</tt>.  The last line actually quotes
the <tt>fopen()</tt> error string, <tt>strerror(errno)</tt>.  The code
which printed out this error information is (copied from in
<tt>teem/src/nrrd/test/tread.c</tt>):

<blockquote><pre>
  if (nrrdLoad(nin=nrrdNew(), ninName)) {
    fprintf(stderr, "%s: couldn't open nrrd \"%s\":\n%s", me, ninName,
        err = biffGetDone(NRRD));
    free(err); exit(1);
  }
</pre></blockquote>

Error messages can be transfered from one key to another, as in this
case, where a <b>nrrd</b> error propagated to <b>limn</b>:
<blockquote><pre>
test/tcamanim: trouble making camera path:
[limn] limnCameraPathMake: trouble creating time warp spline
[limn] limnSplineCleverNew: couldn't create spline
[limn] limnSplineNew: given nrrd has problems
[limn] [nrrd] nrrdCheck: nrrd has NULL data pointer
</pre></blockquote>

<p>

Text-based error messages like this have benefits and drawbacks.  The
drawbacks is that until there is a uniform system of error codes to
supplement and/or replace the text error messages, there is absolutely no
way that a function can do any kind of error recovery.  This weakness is
unfortunately inhereted by all the <b>teem</b> libraries that use
<b>biff</b>.  For writing research code (I'm trying to get a PhD here),
this hasn't been a problem.  Any error is effectively a fatal error, and I
want to know exactly what went wrong, rather than have my code get clever
and try to "recover" from invalid input parameters.  But the inability to
systematically interpret errors may be more of an issue for other people
wishing to use <b>teem</b> libraries in a non-research context.  Assuming
that the <b>teem</b> libraries reach some level of maturity in the coming
years, robust error handling will become more of a priority.  It hasn't
been one so far.

<p>

The extremely compelling benefit of using text error messages is that
you can immediately tell exactly what has gone wrong.  In research
contexts, where the priority is implementing novel functionality with
experimental software, the last thing to waste time on is trying to
interpret your own error codes, or deal with the consequences of not
having specific error codes.  Having a simple API for adding
descriptive text error messages encourages individual tests for the
various assumptions taken in a function, so the resulting <b>biff</b>
message can be extremely specific.  Half the lines of some <b>nrrd</b>
functions, for example, are <b>biff</b>-based tests and error messages.

Knowing more than you want about an error is no problem; knowing less
than you want can be a disastrous waste of time.
