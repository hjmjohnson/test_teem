<h2>Using Teem:</h2>

On Windows all the <b>teem</b> libraries are built into one monolithic
mega library, either as a DLL and an import library or as a static
library that <b>teem</b> users can link against.  The <b>teem</b> <a
href="./bin/index.html">command-line utilities</a> are also built
together with these libraries.

<p>

You can download precompiled binaries including DLL and static builds.
For the DLL version, you'll need to copy <tt>bin/teem.dll</tt> to
where your binary is or somewhere within the Windows path, typically
<tt>%SystemRoot%/system32</tt>.  For the compression encodings and png
support, you'll need to copy the provided libraries
<tt>bin/z.dll</tt>, <tt>bin/bz2.dll</tt>, and <tt>bin/png.dll</tt> to
the same directory in case you do not have them yet. The import
libraries are located in <tt>lib/shared</tt>.

<p>

Note that the precompiled binaries are linked against the
<b>multithreaded DLL</b> version of the Windows C runtime library
<tt>MSVCRT.lib</tt>.  This means that you have to link against the same
library in your project by setting the appropriate compiler flag
(<tt>/MD</tt>), which is unfortunately not the default setting in Visual Studio.
Linking against a different version will result in <b>unexpected
crashes</b> of your program.

<p>

When using the static version of teem, located in <tt>lib/static</tt>,
you need to define TEEM_STATIC when you compile your source
(-DTEEM_STATIC), otherwise your program will <b>crash</b>.

<h2>Building Teem:</h2>
<ol>

<li> <a href="download/index.html">Download</a> the <b>teem</b>
distribution

<li> Untar it.<br>
Throughout this and all other <b>teem</b> documentation, the directory
just created will be referred to as "<tt>teem</tt>", even though it
will actually be called "<tt>teem-1.XblahN</tt>" or something similar.

<li> Go into this directory.

<li> Go into the <tt>win32/build</tt> directory.

</ol>

<h3>Visual Studio 6.0 users</h3>
<ol> 
<li> Open the Visual Studio 6.0 workspace file <tt>teem.dsw</tt>.
<li> Select the configuration you want to build using 
the <tt>"Build"</tt> menu's <tt>"Set Active Configuration"</tt> item.  You
have two choices: <tt>Release</tt> and <tt>Debug</tt>.
<li> Select all projects by shift-clicking on them in the workspace file-view
window.
<li> Right click on the selection and hit <tt>"Build"</tt> in the
pop-up menu.
</ol>

<h3>Visual Studio .NET users</h3>
<ol>
<li> Open the Visual Studio 6.0 workspace file <tt>teem.dsw</tt>.
<li> Convert all project files to the .NET format.
<li> Select the configuration you want to build using 
the <tt>"Build"</tt> menu's <tt>"Configuration Manager"</tt> item.
You have two choices: <tt>Release</tt> and <tt>Debug</tt>.
<li> In the solution explorer window right click on <tt>"Solution teem"</tt> and hit
<tt>"Build Solution"</tt> in the pop-up menu.
</ol>

The libraries and executables are compiled in the <tt>win32/lib</tt>
and <tt>win32/bin</tt> subdirectories.  To install them, you need to
copy the DLL and the executables manually to a directory in the
Windows path <tt>%PATH%</tt>.  In this case, the import library
<tt>teem.lib</tt> usually goes into one of the Visual Studio library
directories, e.g. <tt>'path to visual studio'\Vc98\lib</tt>.
Likewise, the headers can be placed in one of the Visual Studio
include directories.
<p>

To uninstall <b>teem</b> you have to delete the installed files
manually.
<p>

The <b>zlib</b>, <b>bzip2</b>, and <b>libpng</b> libraries are also
available in source form at <a
href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/">http://www.gzip.org/zlib/</a>, <a
href="http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/">http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/</a>,
and <a
href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html">http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html</a>.
<p>

No <b>teem</b> development is currently done on Windows.  Using the
Visual Studio files is simply the path-of-least-borg-resistance for
distributing sources in a form that facilitates easy building on
Windows.
