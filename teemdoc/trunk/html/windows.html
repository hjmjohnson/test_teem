<h2>Using Teem:</h2>

On Windows all the <b>teem</b> libraries are built into one monolithic
DLL and an import library that <b>teem</b> users can link against.
The teem <a href="./bin/index.html">command-line utilities</a> 
are also built together with these libraries.

<p>

You can download precompiled binaries with the compression encodings
enabled or not.  For both, you'll need to copy <tt>lib/teem.dll</tt>
to somewhere within the Windows path.  For the compression encodings,
you'll need to download (and copy into Windows path) the DLLs for zlib
and bzip2 as described below.

<p>

Note that the precompiled binaries are linked against the
<b>multithreaded DLL</b> version of the Windows C runtime library
(MSVCRT.lib).  This means that you have to link against the same
library in your project by setting the appropriate compiler flag
(/MD), which is unfortunately not the default setting in Visual Studio.
Linking against a different version will result in <b>unexpected
crashes</b> of your program.

<h2>Building Teem:</h2>
<ol>

<li> <a href="download/index.html">Download</a> the <b>teem</b>
distribution

<li> Untar it.<br>
Throughout this and all other <b>teem</b> documentation, the directory
just created will be referred to as "<tt>teem</tt>", even though it
will actually be called "<tt>teem-1.XblahN</tt>" or something similar.

<li> Go into this directory.

<li> Go into the "win32/make" directory.

</ol>

<h3>Visual Studio 6.0 users</h3>
<ol> 
<li> Go into the "vc6" directory.
<li> Open the Visual Studio 6.0 workspace file (teem.dsw).
<li> Select the configuration you want to compile (Release / Debug /
Release Compression / Debug Compression) using
the Build menu's Set Active Configuration item.
<li> Select all projects by shift-clicking on them in the workspace file-view
window.
<li> Right click on the selection and hit "Build" in the
pop-up menu.
</ol>

<h3>Visual Studio .NET users</h3>
<ol>
<li> Go into the "vc7" directory.
<li> Open the Visual Studio .NET solution file (teem.sln).
<li> Select the configuration you want to compile
(Release / Debug / Release + Compression / Debug + Compression) using
the Build menu's Configuration Manager item.
<li> In the solution explorer window right click on "Solution 'teem'" and hit
"Build Solution" in the pop-up menu.
</ol>

The libraries and executables are compiled in the win32/lib and win32/bin
 subdirectories.  By default these files and the public headers are copied into the
bin, lib, and include subdirectories of the teem root directory during
 the build.  Optionally, you can set the $TEEM_DEST environment variable to
  customize the installation.  Note that the directory $TEEM_DEST
 points to must contain bin, lib, and include subdirectories, 
otherwise the installation will fail.

You can also copy the dll and the executables manually to a directory in the Windows
path ($PATH).  In this case, the import library (teem.lib) usually goes into one of
the Visual Studio library directories (e.g. 'path to visual
studio'\Vc7\lib).  Likewise, the headers can be placed in one of the Visual
Studio include directories.

<p>

The compression options require the zlib and bzip2 libraries, which
are available in source or precompiled Windows binary form at <a
href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/">http://www.gzip.org/zlib/</a> and 
<a
href="http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/">http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/</a>.
These libraries must be available to the compiler, e.g. by copying the
import libraries and headers to the Visual Studio library and include
subdirectories, otherwise the build will fail.

<p>

No <b>teem</b> development is currently done on Windows.  Using the
Visual Studio files is simply the path-of-least-borg-resistance for
distributing sources in a form that facilitates easy building on
Windows.
