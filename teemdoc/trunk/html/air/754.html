    <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>IEEE 754 floats</b></h2>
</table>

IEEE 754 is the standard that governs how modern computers represent
floating point numbers.  One aspect of IEEE 754 which people tend not
to exploit is its ability to represent special values like
Not-A-Number, and +/-Infinity.  The <b>air</b> library has a number of
macros and functions which are intended to make working with these
quantities easier.

<hr noshadow width="70%">

<h2>"Existant" values</h2>

Parts of teem, especially <a
href="../nrrd/index.html"><b>nrrd</b></a>, rely on the notion of a
floating point value "existing" or not.  A value "exists" if it is not
a 754 special value, that is, its not infinity, and not NaN. In
<b>nrrd</b>, for instance, many operations are defined to only operate
on the existant values.  Nrrd's average of 1000 numbers, containing
one NaN and one infinity, will actually be the average of the 998
"existant" numbers.  However, any naive C or C++ implementation will
result in the final answer being NaN.  Some way of determine if a
value exists is required.

<p>

Sadly, this requires some care.  Ideally, we could define a macro like
this:
<blockquote><pre>
#define AIR_EXISTS(x) ((x) == (x))
</pre></blockquote>

This is supposed to work because x isn't equal to itself if x is a
special value, but many compilers will reduce this to true, even at
low optimization levels. So, we could try this:
<blockquote><pre>
#define AIR_EXISTS(x) (!((x) - (x)))
</pre></blockquote>

For special values, x&nbsp;-&nbsp;x is not 0, so this should work.  But some
compilers (such as 64-bit Irix6 with "-Ofast", and Visual Studio)
again decree that AIR_EXISTS() is true for any possible value of x.
To be completely thorough, one has to actually look at the bit patterns
of the values, at which point you have to be specific to the
<tt>float</tt>/ <tt>double</tt> type, and correct about their byte-sizes:
<blockquote><pre>
#define AIR_EXISTS_F(x) ((*(unsigned int*)&(x) & 0x7f800000) != 0x7f800000)
#define AIR_EXISTS_D(x) (                               \
  (*(airULLong*)&(x) & AIR_ULLONG(0x7ff0000000000000))  \
    != AIR_ULLONG(0x7ff0000000000000))
</pre></blockquote>

We want to avoid false negatives for <tt>double</tt>s with values greater
than <tt>FLT_MAX</tt>, so if we had to pick one of these to wrap in a
single function that was used for both <tt>float</tt> and <tt>double</tt>,
it would be the second.  This is the approach currently taken: on machines
for which (!((x)&nbsp;-&nbsp;(x))) doesn't work because of optimizations,
we resort to casting the value to double, and looking at its bits (done
in <tt>airExists_d()</tt>).  Thus, in <tt>air.h</tt> we find:
<blockquote><pre>
#ifdef WIN32
#define AIR_EXISTS(x) (airExists_d(x))
#else
#define AIR_EXISTS(x) (!((x) - (x)))
#endif
</pre></blockquote>

Hopefully, at some soon, teem will be made with the assistance of a
highly customized GNU configure script which will determine these
things on a per-architecture, per-optimization basis.  The above
solution works on all platforms that <b>teem</b> compiles on, using
the optimization levels that the makefiles supply (generally -O2).
A function called <tt>airSanity()</tt> makes sure that all IEEE 754-related 
macros (such as <tt>AIR_EXISTS()</tt>) work correctly.

<hr noshadow width="70%">

<h2>Not-A-Number</h2>

Not-A-Number, or "NaN", doesn't represent a real value, but rather the
fact that there is no value to be represented.  Various <b>teem</b>
libraries, especially <a href="../nrrd/index.html"><b>nrrd</b></a>,
use NaN as a flag to mean "don't know".  This use is completely in
keeping with the 754 spec.  However, the special semantics of NaN mean
that it is not trivial to create a <tt>#define</tt> or a compile-time
constant to hold this value (as is possible with say, <tt>M_PI</tt>),
and it is not trivial to test to see if a value is NaN.  This may be
why more people don't use NaN as a flag, but <b>air</b> is useful
here.

<p>

One thing to keep in mind: Section 6.2 of IEEE 754 guarantees that a
NaN stored in a <tt>float</tt> will stay a NaN when stored in a
<tt>double</tt>, and vice versa.  Thus, you need not be cautious about
the "precision" of your NaN.  The same doesn't exactly hold for
infinity, though.

<p>

<b>How to get NaN</b>: If you want a NaN, so that you can save it into
a floating point variable, perhaps as an indicator for "don't know",
or "uninitialized", you have a few options.

<ol>

<li> (fastest) Use <tt>AIR_NAN</tt>, as in "<tt>float
nan=AIR_NAN;</tt>".  <tt>AIR_NAN</tt> is a #define for
<tt>airFloatNaN.f</tt>, which is the <tt>float</tt> field of the
<tt>airFloatNaN</tt> union, which is itself a compile-time constant,
defined in <tt>teem/src/754.c</tt>

<li> (slower) Use <tt>airFPGen_f(airFP_QNAN)</tt>, which tells
the <tt>airFPGen_f()</tt> function to generate a <tt>float</tt> of the
class <tt>airFP_QNAN</tt>.  Calling <tt>airNaN()</tt> is a wrapper around
this.

<li> Do it yourself.  Store 0.0 in some <tt>float</tt> variable
<tt>nan</tt>, and then <tt>"nan /= nan"</tt>.  You have to create a
seperate variable in order to avoid compiler warnings about the
division by zero.

</ol>

<b>How to test for NaN</b>: If you want to see if a variable
<tt>x</tt> of type <tt>float</tt> is NaN, you can do one of the
following.  Both of these return non-zero when the passed value
is a NaN, and zero when it is not.

<ol>

<li> (easiest to remember) Use <tt>AIR_EXISTS(x)</tt>, described
above.  Will be false for NaNs and infinities.

<li> (fastest) Use <tt>AIR_ISNAN_F(x)</tt>, a macro which does bit-masking
to look at the exponent and fraction fields of the <tt>float</tt>

<li> (slower) Use <tt>airIsNaN(x)</tt>.  Same as macro, but uses a
union to access the exponent and fraction fields.

<li> See if return from <tt>int airFPClass_f(float val)</tt> is
<tt>airFP_SNAN</tt> or <tt>airFP_QNAN</tt>.

</ol>

If you have a variable that is of type <tt>double</tt>, you must use
the second option, because the value will be cast to <tt>float</tt> as
part of the function call <tt>airIsNaN</tt>, but NOT as part of macro
invocation <tt>AIR_ISNAN_F</tt>.

<p>

There are in fact two kinds of NaNs, the signaling NaN and the quiet
NaN.  Nothing in <b>teem</b> attempts to use the floating point
exception handler to work with signaling NaNs, because there isn't a
cross-platform C-language API to the floating point hardware.  Also,
nothing in <b>teem</b> attempts to use the integer value stored in the
fraction field of the NaN to represent different kinds of conditions
of NaN, so effectively, a NaN is a NaN is a NaN.  However, an effort
is made to make <tt>AIR_NAN</tt> be what the local architecture
considers a quiet NaN, in case using a signalling NaN could have an
impact on performace.

<hr noshadow width="70%">

<h2>Infinities</h2>

A <tt>float</tt> infinity, when assigned to <tt>double</tt>, stays
infinity (with the same sign), and vice versa.  But if a
<tt>double</tt> holds a large value (larger than <tt>FLT_MAX</tt>) and
this is assigned to a <tt>float</tt>, an infinity will result.  Thus,
detecting an infinity has to be done either with functions specific to
the type of the value, or (being conservative), with functions which
take a <tt>double</tt> argument.

<p>

<b>To generate an infinity:</b>

<ol>

<li>Use <tt>AIR_POS_INF</tt> or <tt>AIR_NEG_INF</tt>, a
<tt>#define</tt> for the float component of <tt>airFloatPosInf</tt>
or <tt>airFloatNegInf</tt>; these are compile-time constant unions.

<li>Use <tt>airFPGen_f(airFP_POS_INF)</tt> or
<tt>airFPGen_f(airFP_NEG_INF)</tt>

</ol>

<b>To test if something is infinity:</b>

<ol>

<li> (easiest to remember) Use <tt>AIR_EXISTS(x)</tt>, described
above.  Will be false for NaNs and infinities.

<li>Use <tt>int airIsInf_f(float f)</tt> (or <tt>int airIsInf_d(double
d)</tt>).  These return 1 when given a positive infinity, -1 when
given a negative infinity, and 0 otherwise.

<li> See if return from <tt>int airFPClass_f(float val)</tt> (or
<tt>int airFPClass_d(double val)</tt>) is
<tt>airFP_POS_INF</tt> or <tt>airFP_NEG_INF</tt>.

</ol>

<hr noshadow width="70%">

<h2>Determining/generating floating point classes</h2>

<tt>air.h</tt> has an enum for the different classes that a floating
point number can belong to:
<blockquote><pre>
enum {
  airFP_Unknown,               /*  0: nobody knows */
  airFP_SNAN,                  /*  1: signalling NaN */
  airFP_QNAN,                  /*  2: quiet NaN */
  airFP_POS_INF,               /*  3: positive infinity */
  airFP_NEG_INF,               /*  4: negative infinity */
  airFP_POS_NORM,              /*  5: positive normalized non-zero */
  airFP_NEG_NORM,              /*  6: negative normalized non-zero */
  airFP_POS_DENORM,            /*  7: positive denormalized non-zero */
  airFP_NEG_DENORM,            /*  8: negative denormalized non-zero */
  airFP_POS_ZERO,              /*  9: +0.0, positive zero */
  airFP_NEG_ZERO,              /* 10: -0.0, negative zero */
  airFP_Last                   /* after the last valid one */
};
</pre></blockquote>

Values (of type <tt>int</tt>) from this enum are used in conjunction
with:
<ul><li>
<blockquote><pre>
float airFPGen_f(int cls);
double airFPGen_d(int cls);
</pre></blockquote>
These generate <tt>float</tt> or <tt>double</tt> values of the
given class.
</ul>

<ul><li>
<blockquote><pre>
int airFPClass_f(float val);
int airFPClass_d(double val);
</pre></blockquote>
These categorize a given floating-point value into one of the classes.
</ul>

Ideally, I wouldn't have to reimplement these, since most platforms
have them in some form or another.  But they are not part of ANSI C,
so each platform has its own name for the header file in which these
are found, different enum names for the different classes, and even
different corresponding numeric values.


<hr noshadow width="70%">
<h2>Converting between floating-point values and integer triples</h2>

There are a number of functions for creating and querying floating
point values, written largely for the sake of learning about 754.

<ul><li>
<blockquote><pre>
float airFPPartsToVal_f(int sign, int exp, int frac);
void airFPValToParts_f(int *signP, int *expP, int *fracP, float v);
</pre></blockquote>

Let you convert between a <tt>float</tt> and the three integral fields
which comprise it: 1-bit sign, 8-bit exponent, and 23-bit fraction.
</ul>

<ul><li>
<blockquote><pre>
double airFPPartsToVal_d(int sign, int exp, airULLong frac);
void airFPValToParts_d(int *signP, int *expP, airULLong *fracP, double v);
</pre></blockquote>

Same thing, but for <tt>double</tt>.  <tt>airULLong</tt> is just
another name for <tt>unsigned long long</tt>, which Microsoft calls an
"<tt>unsigned __int64</tt>".  A <tt>double</tt> is a 1-bit sign,
11-bit exponent, 52-bit fraction.
</ul>

<hr noshadow width="70%">
<h2>Printing individual bits</h2>

In case you don't trust yourself to read the hex output from the
"<tt>%x</tt>" printf() conversion sequence, you can look at all
the individual bits of a <tt>float</tt> or <tt>double</tt>:

<ul><li>
<blockquote><pre>
void airFPFprintf_f(FILE *file, float val);
void airFPFprintf_d(FILE *file, double val);
</pre></blockquote>

Sample output from <tt>airFPFprintf_f(stdout, 42)</tt>:
<blockquote><pre>
42.000000: class 5; 0x42280000 = sign:0x0, exp:0x84, frac:0x280000 = 
 S < . . Exp . . > < . . . . . . . . . Frac. . . . . . . . . . >
 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
</pre></blockquote>

Sample output from <tt>airFPFprintf_d(stdout, 42)</tt>:
<blockquote><pre>
42.000000: class 5; 0x4045000000000000 = 
sign:0x0, exp:0x404, frac:0x5000000000000 = 
S<...Exp...><.......................Frac.......................>
0100000001000101000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
</pre></blockquote>
