<h3>THIS IS UNFINISHED</h3>

(This information is irrelevant for non-Cygwin Windows users)

<p>

<b>Teem</b> uses a system of GNU makefiles in order to build the
software.  The actions of "make" depends on where its invoked in the
tree, what environment variables set, and of course, what targets are
specified.  This system has evolved over the years to match my pattern
of development, which includes working simultaneously on different
platforms which share a file system.  This page aims to describe the
functioning of GNU make with <b>teem</b>, starting with the useful and
ending with the obscure.  Referring to information about the <a
href="../tree/index.html">directory structure</a> may be useful.

<p>

Some terminology.  <b>Teem</b> is made of a number of libraries, such
as <a href="../nrrd/index.html"><b>nrrd</b></a>.  One result of
compiling a library is the creation of some files such as
<tt>libnrrd.a</tt> and <tt>libnrrd.so</tt>.  To distinguish between
the <b>nrrd</b> "library" in general, and these <tt>lib</tt> files, I
call the <tt>lib</tt> files "libs".  <b>Teem</b> also comes with some
simple command-line programs which demonstrate and use the libraries,
I call these "bins".  Many of the libraries have associated testing
programs, compiled from sources in the <tt>test</tt> subdirectory of
each library.  These programs are called "tests".

<p>

Here is an overview of the different ways that you can invoke make,
and how it will behave according to where you're starting it from.

<p>

The makefiles are:
<ul>

<li> <tt>teem/src/GNUmakefile</tt>: The "top-level" makefile.  This
defines variables and functions that are used by all the other files.

<li> <tt>teem/src/make/errorCheck.mk</tt>: Does error checking on the
values of environment variables.

<li> <tt>teem/src/make/&lt;<i>arch</i>&gt;.mk</tt>: For all the
architectures supported (except Windows), there is an
"architecture-specific" makefile which records the specifics of that
platform.  Which of these is used depends on the value of the
environment variable <tt>TEEM_ARCH</tt>.

<li> <tt>teem/src/&lt;<i>library</i>&gt;/GNUmakefile</tt>: Each
library has its own makefile, recording all library-specific
information, such as names of the public and private headers, and all
the object files required to make the lib.

<li> <tt>teem/src/bin/GNUmakefile</tt>: All the bins are made
according to this makefile, different in structure to the library
makefiles.

<li> <tt>teem/src/make/template.mk</tt>: This is included by all the
library makefiles, but in a way which is effectively templated on the
name of the library.  It is actually the most important makefile,
because it expresses all the intra- and inter- library dependencies.

<li> <tt>teem/src/make/externals.mk</tt>: This helps coordinate the
optional linking in of external libraries that extend the
functionality of <b>teem</b>, such as gzip compression for
<b>nrrd</b>.

<li> <tt>teem/src/make/compare.sh</tt>: Not actually a makefile, but
used by <tt>template.mk</tt> (via the <tt>newer.than</tt> function
defined in <tt>teem/src/GNUmakefile</tt>) to compare file dates, in
a way seperate from make's network of targets and prerequisites.

</ul>

<b>Environment variables</b>:  The environment variables
specific to <tt>teem</tt> all start with <tt>TEEM_</tt>.  Currently,
their only role is to control how "make" runs to build things.
These are the variables which have a global effect on how all 
<tt>teem</tt> libraries are built.  More specific information
about the system of Makefiles can be found <a href="make.html">here</a>.
<table border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3>
<tr>
 <td align=right><tt>TEEM_ARCH</tt>
 <td>The architecture you're compiling with and for.
 <b>This is the only environment variable which MUST be set</b>
 in order to build libraries in <tt>teem</tt>.  Currently supported
 are "irix6.n32", "irix6.64", "linux", and "solaris".
<tr>
 <td align=right><tt>TEEM_LINK_SHARED</tt>
 <td>If set to the string "true" then binaries, when linked, will be
  linked with shared libraries, and not static libraries. If not set,
  we link against static libraries, in order to produce
  stand-alone binaries (or as stand-alone as the system allows).
<tr>
 <td align=right><tt>TEEM_PURIFY</tt>
 <td>If set to "true", run purify on all compiles and links.
  The architecture-specific makefile must define <tt>PURIFY</tt>.
