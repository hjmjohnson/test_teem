<p>

My software, <a href="index.html">teem</a>, is released under the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#LGPL">GNU Lesser
General Public License</a> ("LGPL"), for a variety of reasons.  Most
importantly, this license best implements to the notion of "share and
share alike" which is fundamental to academic research.  Also, because
the development of this software was largely funded by the tax paying
American public, I feel obligated to prevent situations where my
software is used but can not be inspected, understood, or altered at
the level of source code.

<p>

It is important to understand the difference between the LGPL and the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL">GNU General
Public License</a> ("GPL").  Some people dismiss all GNU licenses as
"viral", which is both unfortunate and false.  The most important
difference between GPL and LGPL is that if your software uses teem,
you are in no way required to release the source for your software.
However, because my software is not in the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html#PublicDomainSoftware">public
domain</a>, or under a <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#BSD-style">"BSD-Style"</a>
<a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html#Non-CopyleftedFreeSoftware">free
license</a>, there are certain requirements.  See <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html">this page</a> for
clarification on the different kinds of licenses.
Keep in mind, however, that the LGPL-related requirements kick in
<b>only</b> when you start distributing your software outside of your
school, lab, or company.

<p>

After reading through the LGPL very carefully, I wrote up the
following description of it, and the (minimal) responsibilities you
have if you release software which uses teem. Others have found it
helpful because it clarifies whether or not the LGPL makes a
distinction between static versus dynamic linking (the answer is no,
and yes).  Also, it enumerates exactly what you'd need to do if you
release software that uses teem (not much).  Please
read on.

<p>

<p>

The notion of a "derived work" is central to copyright law, because
copyright concerns itself not just with a work, but with anything
which is a modified version of the original work, or a translated
version of the work, or which is (or contains) a significant portion
of the work, and so on.

<p>

If you link my library with your program, the resulting binary is
derived from my library (in the copyright sense) because the binary
contains translated portions of my code.  The GNU licenses make no
distinction between static and dynamic linking <b>insofar as the
definition of a derived work, as applied to compiled software, is
concerned</b>.  From the Preamble of the LGPL: "When a program is
linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library,
the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a
derivative of the original library."

<p>

One reason that the LGPL is a longer and more complicated document
than the GPL is that the LGPL makes a distinction between different
kinds of derived works, which the GPL does not make.  Section 2(b) of
the GPL applies to <b>any</b> derived work that you distribute or
publish, requiring that the derived work be licensed under the GPL.
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">Read the GPL</a> for
exactly what that entails; it involves distribution of your program's
source code.  The LGPL also says that it applies to all derived works.
But the basic thing to understand is that <b>how</b> the LGPL applies
in fact depends on the nature of the derived work:

<ol>

<li> If the derived work entails a modification of teem itself or some
portion of it, then you have a "work based on the library".  Section
2(c) of the LGPL applies to that derived work as soon as you
distribute it, requiring that the work be licensed under the LGPL.

<li> If the derived work is a binary created by linking against teem
(or your modification of it), then you have a "work which uses the
library".  Section 6 of the LGPL applies to this work as soon as you
distribute it, saying that the derived work can be distributed "under
the terms of your choice, provided that ...", and goes on to describe
the responsibilities of someone distributing the derived work.

</ol>

<p>

The important distinction here is that those responsibilities, which
I'll describe below, amount to something <b>less</b> than the full
LGPL.  Those responsibilities are mandated and defined by the LGPL
(since the LGPL governs the distribution of any derived work), but
they are <b>not the same as the LGPL</b>.  Most confusion about the
LGPL revolves around this basic property: Section 6 of the LGPL
constrains (mildly) how you distribute compiled software using a
LGPL'd library, but because those constraints are not the same as the
LGPL, the LGPL does not propogate itself in the same way that the GPL
does.  This is in contrast to what is required when the derived work
involves modification of my source, in which case the full LGPL does
apply.  However, if you have found bugs or API deficiencies in my
software, please tell me, so that everyone can benefit.  Since this
software is how I do research, I'll be supporting it for quite awhile.

<p>

So, if you distribute a program that links against teem, without
modifying teem, Section 6 of the LGPL requires you to do four things:

<ol>

<li> Give notice that your program uses teem, and that teem is covered
by LGPL.  All this means is that in your documentation or descriptive
material, wherever you other list other libraries that you depend on,
you also mention teem, and that its under LGPL.  You would also
mention teem in an enumeration of the different licenses that
govern different parts of your software, if this is the case.

<li> Supply a copy of the LGPL. This is available online in
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">HTML</a> and 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.txt">plain text</a>.
Its also the <tt>teem/src/LICENSE.txt</tt> file in
the teem distribution.

<li> If there is a section of your documentation that gives copyright
notices for other code you use, or if copyright notices are displayed
as part of the program's operation, then you need to show teem's
copyright notice as well:
<blockquote><pre>
  Copyright (C) 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998 University of Utah
</pre></blockquote>

<li> The interesting part: You need to make it possible for users of
your program to modify my teem libraries, and use those modified teem
libraries in your program.  The principle of copyleft is that you pass
on to others the same freedoms as were available to you.  The five
possible ways to facilitate this, listed in Section 6, can be
summarized as two alternatives:

<ol>

  <li> If you <b>statically link</b> against teem libraries,
  you need to accompany the distribution of your program with all
  source files for the required teem libraries, and all the object
  (.o) files (or source files), for your program.
  This way someone could re-link your various object files together
  with modified teem libraries to produce their own version of your
  program.  You don't have to release any source for your program if
  you don't want to.  (This much is from Section 6(a).)  If you don't
  supply these materials alongside the distribution of your program,
  then they need to be conveyed or made available by some other means.
  (This is Sections 6(c)-6(e))

  <li> If you only <b>dynamically link</b> against shared libraries,
  you're done!  The nature of shared libraries means that your program
  will slurp up the teem libraries (original or modified) at run-time.
  <b>You don't even need to distribute teem source</b>.  (This is Section 6(b))

</ol>

</ol>

I mentioned above that the LGPL does not distinguish between static
and dynamic linking insofar as the definition of a derivative work is
concerned.  Section 6 of LGPL says that the distinction between static
and dynamic <b>does</b> matter in the context of how to comply with LGPL,
when you're releasing a program that uses teem without
modifying it.  And this is how I imagine most everyone will use my
libraries-- just linking against them as distributed.  You probably
don't want to be mucking in my source code anyway.

<p>

I feel that the four points of compliance, described above, are clear,
fair, and very easy to deal with, especially if you take the shared
library route.  Also, if you've read this far, please help by clearing
up misunderstandings about the LGPL when you encounter them.
