Generating opacity functions</h2>

<blockquote>

There are a few options here:
<blockquote><pre>
usage: bin/gkms [-b &lt;bemph&gt;] [-f c,w,s,a] [-s &lt;sigma&gt;]
       [-g &lt;gthresh&gt;] [-m &lt;radius&gt;] &lt;input&gt; &lt;output&gt;
Default values are in {}s
  -b bemph : nrrd containing data for boundary emphasis function b(x)
             (no default)
-f c,w,s,a : alternate way of specifying b(x)
             c: where to center support
             w: full-width half-max of support
             s: shape of support (0.0: box, 1.0: tent)
             a: height of function (max opacity)
             {0,1,1,1}
  -s sigma : scaling in position calculation
             larger values ---> narrower opacity functions
             {(automatically calculated)}
-g gthresh : minimum significant gradient mag
             {0.04 * maxgrad}
 -m radius : radius of median filtering, 0 for none
             {0}
     input : 1D or 2D histo-info being analyzed
    output : opacity function to be created
</pre></blockquote>

As with other <tt>gkms</tt> commands, the default settings often do an
okay job, so the opacity function generated by:
<blockquote><pre>
gkms opac engine-info1.nrrd engine-opac1.nrrd
</pre></blockquote>
produces this opacity function, and this image:
<center>
<img width=326 height=300 src="img/opac00.gif">
<img width=330 height=330 src="img/engine00.jpg">
</center>
Not bad for default settings.  <b>However</b>, it would be <b>quite
unfortunate</b> if comparisons (of other transfer function generation
schemes) with my method were based solely on the output of using these
defaults.

<p>

The plot of opacity function was done
in matlab.  Until I write a <tt>nrrd</tt> reader for matlab, a very
simple way of getting 1-D data into matlab is with <tt>unrrdu</tt>'s
"2a" program, plus judicious use of tail, to cut away the NRRD header
information.
<blockquote>
<tt>2a engine-opac1.nrrd - | tail +10 &gt; engine-opac11.txt</tt><br>
(then, inside matlab) <tt>&gt;&gt; v = dlmread('engine-opac11.txt'); plot(v);</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>

The default setting is that sigma and gthresh are determined
automatically, but the heuristics for doing this are not too bright.
Sigma is defined to be half the thickness of the transition region
between materials, as measured in voxels; <a
href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~gk/MS/html/node17.html#fig:thickdemo">here's
a picture</a>.  For this dataset, the automatic calculation of sigma is
2.39167.  This is really much to high; 1.5 is probably more accurate:
<blockquote><pre>
gkms opac -s 1.5 engine-info1.nrrd engine-opac11.nrrd
</pre></blockquote>
<center>
<img width=326 height=300 src="img/opac01.gif">
<img width=330 height=330 src="img/engine01.jpg">
</center>
This is the general rule with setting sigma: the lower the value, the
thicker the opaque region in the opacity function, so boundaries
become more opaque.  You may wonder why the the boundary isn't totally
opaque, given that the opacity function goes all the way to 1.0.
Well, there's a good reason for that having to do with
appearance-preserving sampling rate control in raycast volume
rendering; this subtlety has been discussed elsewhere.

<p>

The first (leftmost, at lower data values) peak in the opacity
function is for the transition between the background and less
radio-opaque of the two materials.  To show that the second peak
isn't wildly misplaced:
<center>
<img width=326 height=300  src="img/opac02.gif">
<img width=330 height=330 src="img/engine02.jpg">
</center>
There seems to be a lot of junk that isn't a boundary, which is being
rendered by this opacity function.  That's because there is <b>no</b>
one-dimensional opacity function which can accurately display the
<b>three</b> boundaries which are present in this dataset.  Given that
my method tries dutifully to generate opacity functions which make
<b>all</b> boundaries opaque, it is bound to get a little confused
here.

<p>

One way to fix this is to use a two-dimensional opacity function.  This
allows you to disambiguate between different boundaries based on their
gradient magnitudes.  <tt>gkms opac</tt> generates two-dimensional
opacity functions just as easily as one-dimensional (and let's make
the boundaries a little thicker still, by setting sigma to 1.0):
<blockquote><pre>
gkms opac -s 1 engine-info2.nrrd engine-opac21.nrrd
</pre></blockquote>
<center>
<img width=256 height=256  src="img/opac21.gif">
<img width=330 height=330 src="img/engine03.jpg">
</center>

The gray-scale image of the 2-D opacity function indicates higher
opacity with higher brightness.  Just as with the scatterplots and the
images of p(v,g), data value is on the horizontal axis, and gradient
magnitude is the vertical axis.  There is some ambient fuzz in the
image, caused by the inappropriate inclusion of some low gradient
magnitude values in the opacity function.  The output of the above
command notifies us that the automatically calculated gthresh was
5.09551; lets raise that:

<blockquote><pre>
gkms opac -s 1 -g 15 engine-info2.nrrd engine-opac22.nrrd
</pre></blockquote>
<center>
<img width=256 height=256  src="img/opac22.gif">
<img width=330 height=330 src="img/engine04.jpg">
</center>
The general rule for setting gthresh is this: set as high as necessary
to get rid of background material which would otherwise be made
opaque.  For one-dimensional opacity functions, it also serves to
<b>narrow</b> the width of the peaks in the opacity function.  There
is a new problem in this image though- a slight speckling on the
surface- spots that are either too bright or dark.  This is (I
believe) caused by the fact that the semi-automatically generated
opacity function has many small gaps and holes in it, due to its close
connection to the histogram volume.  This can be largely remedied
with a bit of median filtering applied to the 2D opacity function:
<blockquote><pre>
gkms opac -s 1 -g 15 -m 1 engine-info2.nrrd engine-opac22.nrrd
</pre></blockquote>
<center>
<img width=256 height=256  src="img/opac23.gif">
<img width=330 height=330 src="img/engine05.jpg">
</center>
Now we can show how there are three boundaries in the engine block
dataset, by first taking away the boundary between background and
the less dense material:
<center>
<img width=256 height=256  src="img/opac24.gif">
<img width=330 height=330 src="img/engine06.jpg">
</center>
Splendid.  Now, we can show that there really are two very
distinct boundaries left, by assinging different colors to them.
The second image shows the color part of the transfer function,
which to this point has been all white.
<center>
<img width=256 height=256  src="img/opac24.gif">
<img width=256 height=256  src="img/opac25.gif">
<img width=330 height=330 src="img/engine07.jpg">
</center>
The blue part of the boundary is the surface between the low density
and high density materials.  The yellow part of the surface is the
surface between the high density material and air.  It is the yellow
surface which can not be selectively rendered with a one-dimensional
opacity function (or any isosurface).

<p>

The editing which produced the last opacity and color functions was
done by hand.  In a paint program.  This is not as ridiculous as it
may sound, for this reason: the different boundaries in the volume,
are quite graphically depicted in the <a href="pvg.html">p(v,g)
images</a>, so there is no shortage of guidance on where the
projections of the three different boundaries fall in the
two-dimensional value-gradient space.  Based on that guidance, there
is no guesswork in deciding where to edit out opacity or paint in
colors.

<p> One parameter in the opacity function hasn't been played with: the
boundary emphasis function.  The command-line paramters allow you to
create anything between a box function and a tent function, with
arbitrary height, and arbitrary position ... More information as time
permits ...
