<blockquote>

Here all the steps it took to go from a volume in non-nrrd format
to an opacity function:

<ol>

<li>
<pre>
unu make -h -i ./engine.den -t uchar -s 256 256 110 -sp 1 1 1 -c engine \
  -bs 62 -e raw -o engine.den.nhdr
unu crop -i engine.den.nhdr -min 59 20 0 -max 207 227 M -o engine-crop.nrrd
</pre>

From the <a href="dataprep.html">preparing the data</a> section, we
saw how to generate a NRRD header for an existing data file, as
well as cropping it down to size, using <tt>unu</tt>.

<li>
<pre>
gkms hvol -i engine-crop.nrrd -s f:1.0 p:0.005 p:0.6 -o engine-hvol.nrrd
</pre>

This made the <a href="hvol.html">histogram volume</a>  This is the
slowest step.

<p>
<li><b>optional</b>:
<pre>
gkms scat -i engine-hvol.nrrd -o engine-vg2.png engine-vh2.png
</pre>

Making the <a href="scat.html">scatterplots</a> wasn't necessary, but
hopefully it was educational.

<p>
<li>
<pre>
gkms info -i engine-hvol.nrrd -one -o engine-info1.nrrd
gkms info -i engine-hvol.nrrd -o engine-info2.nrrd
</pre>

This <a href="info.html">distilled</a> out the essential information
from the histogram volume.

<p>
<li><b>optional</b>:
<pre>
gkms pvg -i engine-info2.nrrd -o engine-pvg.png
</pre>

This made <a href="pvg.html">pretty pictures</a> of the boundary
characteristics of the dataset, as measured by the histogram volume.

<p>
<li><tt>gkms opac -s 1.5 engine-info1.nrrd engine-opac11.nrrd</tt><br>
<tt>gkms opac -s 1 -g 15 -m 1 engine-info2.nrrd engine-opac22.nrrd</tt><br>

These are two of <a href="opac.html">opacity function</a> commands
that were used.

</ol>

<p>

This research has worked to reduce the numbers of parameter settings
which are necessary to make a direct volume rendering.  Of course,
there are some parameters which remain.  I view these three as
the most important (in order of importance):

<ol>
<li><b>The boundary emphasis function</b>.  This is required, because it is
via this function that an actual opacity assignment is possible.  
One way to describe this research is that it has broken opacity function
generation into two parts, a hard part and an easy part.  The hard part
is largely automated, the easy part is the primary user control.

<p>
<li><b>gthresh, and sigma</b>.  These are parameters which control how
the position function (distance map) is calculated from the histogram
volume, and setting them to good values is pretty important in getting
nice opacity functions out.

<p>
<li><b>Derivative inclusion</b>.  The histogram volume is not useful
if it doesn't contain the important information about the boundaries,
and this information is tied up in derivative measurements taken
throughout the dataset.  The fidelity with which these measurements
are represented in the histogram volume is determined by what range of
derivative values are included in it.

</ol>

Here are some other parameters which matter:

<ul>

<li><b>Choice of second derivative measure</b>.  Actually, I view
this as being part of a larger problem of determining the best way
to measure complex higher order derivatives in volume data, and this
is a research topic unto itself.

<p>
<li><b>Method of histogram volume distillation</b>.  I've usually used
the mean, but experience has shown that the median or the mode work
better on some datasets.

<p>
<li><b>Post-processing of the generated opacity function</b>.  The
median filtering of the 2-D opacity function is one example of this,
cropping out large regions by hand is another.

</ul>

... More experience/suggestions on how to set the remaining parameters as
time permits ...
