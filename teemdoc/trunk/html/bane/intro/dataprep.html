<tt><b>bane</b></tt>/<tt><b>gkms</b></tt> tutorial: Step 0: Preparing
the data</h2>

It is often the case that a given volume dataset needs some
pre-processing before it makes sense to analyze or visualize it.
Cropping out large regions of background value is one common task,
which is demonstrated below, using the <a
href="../../nrrd/"><tt>nrrd</tt></a> and <a
href="../../unrrdu/"><tt>unrrdu</tt></a> parts of <a
href="../../"><tt>teem</tt></a>.  There are many other things which
make sense as pre-processing steps in working with volume data
(down-sampling or re-sampling, quantizing, converting, etc), and
<tt>unrrdu</tt> is probably a good tool for the job.  <b>Please
Note</b>, however, that the usage of the <tt>unrrdu</tt> tools will
change in syntax shortly (to be similar to how the <tt>cvs</tt>
program works, as well as <tt>gkms</tt>), but the basic functionality
will of course remain.

<ol>

<li> The engine-block CT scan dataset is available from
<a href="ftp://www-graphics.stanford.edu/pub/volpack/data/engine/">
Stanford's volpack related pages</a>.  Download the file
<tt>engine.den.Z</tt> and uncompress it, creating the file <tt>engine.den</tt>.

<p>

<li> <tt>engine.den</tt> contains the raw data we care about, plus
some binary header stuff we don't care about.  Sounds like a job for
<a href="../../nrrd/"><tt>nrrd</tt></a>!  We can create a simple ASCII
header file which stays seperate from the data file, called (for
example) <a href="engine.den.nhdr"><tt>engine.den.nhdr</tt></a> which
contains the following:
<blockquote>
<pre>
NRRD00.01
content: engine
type: uchar
dimension: 3
sizes: 256 256 110
labels: "x" "y" "z"
spacings: 1.0 1.0 1.0
data file: ./engine.den
byte skip: 62
encoding: raw
</pre>
</blockquote>
The "<tt>byte skip: 62</tt>" line instructs <tt>nrrd</tt> to start
getting the raw data 62 bytes from the start.  If there were lines of
ASCII header to skip (such as a <a
href="http://www.kitware.com/vtk.html">VTK</a> header), the field
would instead be "<tt>line skip: </tt>".  Not all the fields used above
are absolutely needed; for the curious, here is a minimalist header:
<blockquote>
<pre>
NRRD00.01
type: uchar
dimension: 3
sizes: 256 256 110
data file: ./engine.den
byte skip: 62
encoding: raw
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

<li> As you may already know, this dataset contains a lot of useless
background value.  If we crop it out, all further analysis will run
raster, and the results (including the renderings) will be the same.
Sounds like a job for <a href="../../unrrdu"><tt>unrrdu</tt></a>!
This use of <tt>unrrdu</tt>'s project tool generates a maximum
intensity projection (measure #2) along the Z axis (axis #2) and Y
axis (axis #1) so that we can see how to crop it:
<blockquote>
<pre>
project engine.den.nhdr 2 2 <a href="img/engine.den-maxZ.pgm">engine.den-maxZ.pgm</a>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<center>
<img width=256 height=256 src="img/engine.den-maxZ.gif">
</center>
<blockquote>
<pre>
project engine.den.nhdr 1 2 <a href="img/engine.den-maxY.pgm">engine.den-maxY.pgm</a>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<center>
<img width=256 height=110 src="img/engine.den-maxY.gif">
</center>

<p>

<li> Inspecting the resulting images (with a tool like <a
href="http://www.trilon.com/xv/">xv</a>) tells us that the (x,y)
coordinates (59,207) and (20,227) encompasses all the interesting
stuff with about three voxels of border.  In the Z axis, there is need
for cropping (in fact, it seems to have been a bit too aggressively
cropped already).  If you want to indicate "the last index along this
axis", without knowing how big that axis is, you can use "M" instead
of a number.  Thus, we invoke (<tt>unrrdu</tt>'s) crop as such:

<blockquote><pre>
crop engine.den.nhdr 59 207 20 227 0 M engine-crop.nrrd
</pre></blockquote>

<p>

<li> We can verify that the cropping worked right, with another use of
<tt>project</tt>:
<blockquote><pre>
project engine-crop.nrrd 2 2 <a href="img/engine-crop-maxZ.pgm">engine-crop-maxZ.pgm</a>
</pre></blockquote>

<center>
<img width=149 height=208 src="img/engine-crop-maxZ.gif">
</center>

<p>

<li> Supposing that you don't want the <tt>nrrd</tt> header and the
raw data together in the same file, you break the file into two parts
simply by changing the output filename to end in "<tt>.nhdr</tt>", for
"nrrd header":

<blockquote><pre>
crop engine.den.nhdr 59 207 20 227 0 M engine-crop.nhdr
</pre></blockquote>

The <tt>nrrdSave()</tt> function of <tt>nrrd</tt> interprets this
filename auto-magically, putting the header information in a small
ASCII file called "<tt>engine-crop.nhdr</tt>", while putting all the
raw data with no header whatsoever in seperate file called
"<tt>engine-crop.raw</tt>".
