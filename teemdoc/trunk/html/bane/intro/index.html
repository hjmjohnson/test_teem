Introduction to <tt><b>bane</b></tt>, Using <tt><b>gkms</b></tt></h2>

<blockquote>

What follows is a demonstration of how the <tt>bane</tt> library can
be used, via the <tt>gkms</tt> command-line program, to generate
opacity functions for direct volume rendering of scalar fields.
<tt>gkms</tt> is made from <tt>bin/gkms.c</tt> in the
<tt>src/bane</tt> directory of teem.  It is compiled and copied to
teem's architecture-specific <tt>bin</tt> directory as part of doing
a "make install" on teem.

<p>

This also ends up being an introduction to the ideas behind my my <a
href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~gk/MS">MS thesis</a> and <a
href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~gk/papers/vv98">VolVis98 paper</a>.
While familiarity with those would be helpful here, it is not
essential.

<p>

The <tt>bane</tt> library is not especially optimized for speed,
because having a correct implementation was more important to me than
a fast one.  Not to worry- the slowest part of the analysis takes at
most about a minute.  All the subsequent steps which might be part of
an interactive loop are much, much faster.

<p>

<a href="dataprep.html">
<b>STEP 0</b>: Preparing the data<br>
</a>
Let's use a standard but non-trivial dataset: the
engine-block CT scan.  We will create a volume dataset, in
<tt>nrrd</tt> format, called <tt>engine-crop.nrrd</tt>.

<p>

All the subsequent steps in opacity function generation use the
executable called <tt>gkms</tt>, which is built as part of
installing <b>teem</b>.  Running <tt>gkms</tt> with no arguments
produces a usage message which lists its capabilities:
<!-- 
~/usr/local/irix6.n32/bin/gkms 
-->
<blockquote><pre>
          --- Semi-Automatic Generation of Transfer Functions ---
gkms hvol ... Make histogram volume
gkms scat ... Make V-G and V-H scatterplots
gkms info ... Project histogram volume for opacity function generation
 gkms pvg ... Create color-mapped pictures of p(v,g)
gkms opac ... Generate opacity functions
gkms mite ... Modify opacity function to work with "mite"
 gkms txf ... Create Levoy-style triangular 2D opacity functions
</pre></blockquote>

The following steps will use each of these capabilities in sequence.

<p>

<a href="hvol.html">
<b>STEP 1</b>: Creating the histogram volume
(with <tt>gkms hvol ...</tt>)<br>
</a>
The data structure which is used as the basis for all
later analysis steps is called the "histogram volume".  It is a
record, in the form of a histogram, of the relationship between
three-quantities which matter for describing the boundaries present in
a dataset: "data value" (same as gray value, or intensity, or scalar
value), gradient magnitude, and the second directional derivative
along the gradient direction.

<p>

<a href="scat.html">
<b>STEP 2</b>: Inspecting the histogram volume with scatterplots
(with <tt>gkms scat ...</tt>)<br>
</a>
Once you've made the histogram volume, its nice to be able to look at
it.  There are at least two reasons for this.  First, you want to be
sure that the inclusion ranges set in the previous step were
appropriate.  Specifically, important structures at high derivatives
may have been clipped out, or the inclusion was <b>too</b> generous,
which means that the interesting variation of derivative value was
compressed to a small number of bins.  Second, looking at these
scatterplots may be all you need to start setting opacity functions-
since they can tell you about the boundaries present in the data.
Also, looking at the scatterplots for known datasets can increase your
intuition for the kinds of patterns measured by the histogram volume,
and how they relate to the data itself.

<p>

<a href="info.html">
<b>STEP 3</b>: Distilling the Histogram Volume (with <tt>gkms info
... </tt>)<br>
</a>
My method for analyzing the histogram volume in order to produce an
opacity function does not actually need look at the entire histogram
volume itself; it only needs to look at certain projections, or
distillations, of its contents.  It is these projections which will be
analyzed in later stages to produce opacity functions.  For lack of a
better term, I call these projection "info" files.

<p>

<a href="pvg.html">
<b>STEP 4</b>: Making pictures of p(v,g) (with <tt>gkms
pvg ... </tt>)<br>
</a>
The colormapped graph of the two-dimensional position function p(v,g)
is effectively a portrait of the boundary information which was
captured by the histogram volume.  Although most relevent to the
generation of two-dimensional opacity functions, it also makes sense
to inspect this for making one-dimensional opacity functions, just to
learn how (if at all) appropriate 1-D opacity functions are to the
structures which exist in the data. This also includes a small
digression on what I view as the most problematic (weak) aspect of my
Master's thesis research.

<p>

<a href="opac.html">
<b>STEP 5</b>: Making opacity functions (with <tt>gkms opac
... </tt>)<br>
</a>
Finally, opacity functions.  The reason their generation is
"semi-automatic" is that the user has to supply a final ingredient; a
mapping boundary distance to opacity, the so-called "boundary emphasis
function".  Plus, the "sigma" and "gthresh" knobs may need some
adjustment ...

<p>

<a href="summ.html">
<b>SUMMARY</b>: All the steps, the remaining parameters
</a><br>
A review of all the steps outlined in the previous sections, and a
review of the various parameters that are left to play with using this
method.
