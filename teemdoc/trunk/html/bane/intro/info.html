<tt><b>bane</b></tt>/<tt><b>gkms</b></tt> tutorial: Step 3:
Distilling the Histogram Volume</h2>

<blockquote>

As with the other <tt>gkms</tt> commands, you get usage info for
distilling histogram volumes by supplying no arguments, and invoking
just "gkms info":
<blockquote><pre>
gkms info: Project histogram volume for opacity function generation. This
distills the histogram volume down to the information required to create
either 1-D or 2-D opacity functions.

Usage: gkms info [-m &lt;measr&gt;] [-one] -i &lt;hvolIn&gt; -o &lt;infoOut&gt;

  -m &lt;measr&gt; = How to project along the 2nd derivative axis. Possibilities
               include:
             o "mean": average value
             o "median": value at 50th percentile
             o "mode": most common value
             o "min", "max": probably not useful
               default: "mean"
        -one = Create 1-dimensional info file; default is 2-dimensional
 -i &lt;hvolIn&gt; = input histogram volume (from "gkms hvol")
-o &lt;infoOut&gt; = output info file, used by "gkms pvg" and "gkms opac" (string)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>

There are not too many parameters here.  The dimension of the info
file is determined by the dimensionality of the opacity function you
want to create.  If you're feeling conservative and want to work only
with traditional one-dimensional opacity functions:

<blockquote><pre>
gkms info -i engine-hvol.nrrd -one -o engine-info1.nrrd
</pre></blockquote>

Or, when you're ready to accept two-dimensional opacity functions
into your life:

<blockquote><pre>
gkms info -i engine-hvol.nrrd -o engine-info2.nrrd
</pre></blockquote>

<p>

The "info" files generated by this step are arrays of floating point
numbers which summarize important aspects of the histogram volume.
Specifically, the 1-dimensional "info" files contain essentially g(v)
and h(v), and the 2-dimensional "info" file contains essentially
h(v,g). See <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~gk/MS/html/node18.html">
this section</a> of my MS thesis for definitions of these functions.
One dimensional opacity functions are simple and familiar, but for
many measured datasets the expressive power of two dimensional opacity
functions facilitates a much higher level of control over which
boundaries are rendered, and how.

<p>

There isn't any visual feedback for these programs, so there aren't
any pictures to put on this page.  Chances are, once you've generated
the info files, you can delete the histogram volume, since it isn't
used by any other <tt>gkms</tt> commands.

<p>

The "measr" parameter is not one which I've described in any of my
published work, but which can be useful for analyzing histogram
volumes from some more complicated datasets.  ... More information as
time permits ...
