Creating the Histogram Volume</h2>

<blockquote>

The options for creating histogram volumes are seen by running:
"<tt>gkms hvol</tt>":
<!-- 
~/usr/local/irix6.n32/bin/gkms hvol
-->
<blockquote><pre>
usage: gkms hvol [-s v,g,h] [-p v,g,h] [-d v,g,h] [-h lapl|hess|gmg] &lt;input&gt; &lt;hvolOut&gt;
Default values are in {}s
  -s v,g,h : Strategies for determining inclusion of values in the histogram
             volume.  Each of v,g,h can be ... 
             "f": fraction of maximum range
             "p": percentile of highest values to exclude
             "a": absolute specification
             "s": multiple of standard deviation
             {f,p,p}
  -p v,g,h : Parameters to control chosen inclusion strategies. Each of v,g,h
             should be a scalar value.
             {f: 1.0; p: 0.15; a: (no default); s: 70}
  -d v,g,h : Dimensions of output histogram volume.  Each of v,g,h should be
             an integer
             {256,256,256}
-h lapl|hess|gmg: how to measure second derivative
             "lapl": Laplacian
             "hess": Hessian-based
             "gmg": gradient of gradient magnitude
             {hess}
     input : 3-D scalar nrrd being analyzed
   hvolOut : 3-D histogram volume to be created
</pre></blockquote>

One result of my Master's thesis research is that the chances are very
high that you don't need to worry about any of the optional
command-line parameters!  The default parameters generally work quite
well.  So, for the impatient, this may be all you need:
<blockquote><pre>
gkms hvol engine-crop.nrrd engine-hvol.nrrd
</pre></blockquote>

<p>

The main subtlety in histogram volume creation is deciding what range
of derivative values should be represented by the index space of the
histogram volume.  This aspect of histogram volume creation is called
the "inclusion strategy".  I have found the most reliable way to
determine inclusion is by looking at linear histograms of the
derivative value, and then determining what range would exclude some
<b>percentile</b> of the hits.  This is why the default inclusion
strategy for the first and second derivative axes (of the histogram
volume) is "p".  Any time that the data is something other than
super-clean synthetic data, there are going to be a few very high
derivative values.  These are the voxels which should <b>not</b> be
included in the histogram volume because it would decrease the
precision with which we can represent the meaningful variations in the
derivative values.

<p>

One the other hand, the range of data values should probably be fully
represented, so the inclusion strategy is "f": some <b>fraction</b> of
the full range.  In <tt>gkms</tt>, the default fraction is 1.0, that
is, the whole value range.  In other cases, you know exactly what
range of values to include, in which case it makes the most sense to
use inclusion "a": <b>absolute</b> specification of the derivative
values to be represented by the histogram.  Some multiple of the ("s")
<b>standard deviation</b> may be another interesting inclusion
strategy.

<p>

The next option available in <tt>gkms</tt> is the dimensions ("-d") of
the output histogram volume.  I have found 256<sup>3</sup> to work
fine.  If you want to skimp on how big the histogram volume is, it
makes more sense to skimp on the derivative axes, than on the data
value axis.  For example, to make a histogram volume with only
128 bits for the two derivative axes, you'd run:
<blockquote><pre>
gkms hvol engine-crop.nrrd -d 256,128,128 tmp.hvol
</pre></blockquote>

<p>

Finally, there is the matter of just how to measure the second
derivative.  I know of three different ways of approximating the second
directional derivative along the gradient direction: the Laplician,
something based on the Hessian, and something based on the gradient of
the gradient magnitude.  As explained in <a
href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~gk/MS/html/node34.html">Appendix C</a>
of my thesis, I feel the Hessian-based measure is probably the best,
so it is the default.
