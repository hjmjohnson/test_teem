Computer science graduate students should not be spending their time
writing libraries for command-line parsing.  I spent the time to write
this because I couldn't find a simple C library with the features I
was after: flagged and unflagged, variable and fixed arguments of many
different types, with response files, and automatic generation of
usage and option information.  The primary motivation for this was to
provide a consistent command-line interface for all the <a
href="../unrrdu/index.html"><b>unrrdu</b></a> tools.  I can only hope that other
people can find some use for this.

<p>

The current <b>hest</b> implementation has some characteristics which
should probably be considered short-comings, but in the interests of
time and simplicity I've decided to document them, rather than fix them.
In order of decreasing importance:

<ul>

<li>String parameters shouldn't contain space, because the simple
methods of parsing the parameters into options can get confused.

<li>Only one level of response file expansion is supported: response
files themselves can't name more response files in which to find
further arguments.

<li>There is no simple way for the <tt>hestParse()</tt> caller to know
what string or strings were parsed in order to specify the value for
an option.

<li>Only one one unflagged variable parameter option.  One could
theoretically deal with a sequence of unflagged single variable
parameter options at the very end of the command line (with usage info
like "<tt>[&lt;a&gt; [&lt;b&gt; [&lt;c&gt;]]]</tt>"), but this
requires more complicated logic.

</ul>

Surely there are other short-comings, hopefully the <tt>hestParm</tt>
argument to all the important functions will provide the avenue for
increased future flexibility.

<p>

Like much of <b>teem</b>, <b>hest</b> has been <a

to minimize the chance of memory leaks, which is important given how
much dynamic memory allocation it does.
