Here are aspects of the NRRD file format and/or the <b>nrrd</b>
library that may inform a decision on how to best store, communicate,
and manipulate raster data:

<blockquote>

<b>Simplicity</b>: Stark simplicity is the main principle of nrrd.
The file format is a human-readable ASCII header followed by the data.
The data structure is a thin wrapper around a <tt>void*</tt>.  The
<b>nrrd</b> library has simple calls like <tt>nrrdLoad()</tt> and
<tt>nrrdSave()</tt> which do what you expect.  There is no attempt to
provide clever layers of abstraction or indirection, only the basic
facilities to represent and manipulate raster data.  <b>Nrrd</b> is
written in plain C.  Numerous people have found it very easy to write
their own customized C++ wrappers around <b>nrrd</b>.

<p>

<b>Functionality</b>: the <b>nrrd</b> library supports about two dozen
operations on nrrds, nearly all of which are general with respect to
the type and dimension of the nrrd.  Operations include: slicing,
joining, cropping, padding, projecting, histogramming, histogram
equalization, quantizing, axis permuting, color mapping, gamma correction,
component-wise arithmetic operations like adding and multiplying, as
well as filtered resampling (up and down) with arbitrary seperable
kernels.

<p>

<b>Detached headers</b>: The ability to have the NRRD header in a
seperate file than the data file, and the ability to skip past lines
or bytes of another format's ascii or binary header, means that nrrd
plays well with other file formats.

<p>

<b>Portability</b>: <b>nrrd</b> has been compiled on Windows,
Macintosh (OS X), Cygwin, GNU/Linux, Solaris, and Irix (both 32 and 64
bit).  Big-versus-Little endianness is explicitly recorded in the NRRD
header when necessary, and <b>nrrd</b> can convert between the two as
needed.  <b>nrrd</b> makes some assumptions about type sizes, which
aren't strictly speaking portable, but none these have been a problem
on the current set of platforms.

<p>

<b>Availability</b>: The <b>nrrd</b> library and associated utilities
are <a href="../download/index.html">available for download</a> in
source and binary forms.  All this software is distributed under the
terms of the <a href="../lgpl.html">LGPL</a>.

<p>

<b>Representational power</b>: The <tt>Nrrd</tt> struct can represent
raster data of any type and any dimension.  Ten basic C types are
supported (from 8-bit integers to 64-bit doubles), as well as a
"block" type for representing arbitrary chunks of memory, such as C
structs or C++ objects.  Key/value pairs of strings can be stored in
the <tt>Nrrd</tt> struct and the NRRD file format, as a simple but 
effective means of storing general information about the array,
such as a URL giving the data source, or DICOM sequence numbers.
Various kinds of array-specific information is
represented and saved to file, such as sample spacing along each axis,
node versus cell centering, <tt>char*</tt> labels for each axis, and
comments.  Peripheral information is maintained and generated by
<b>nrrd</b> functions.  A resampled image will know its new sample
spacings as compared to the original.  If you quantize floating-point
data down to 8, 16, or 32 bits, the <tt>Nrrd</tt> will remember the
original min and max values prior to quantization.

<p>

<b>Flexibility in file formats</b>: The data in NRRD files can be raw,
ascii, or compressed.  The <b>nrrd</b> library can read and write more
than just NRRD files.  PNG, PPM, and PGM image files can be used to
save nrrds of the appropriate type and dimension, and comments in the
header losslessly encode all other peripheral information represented
by <b>nrrd</b>.  For one and two dimensional data, plain text files
with no header whatsoever (such as produced by Excel when exporting to
plain text) are read and written with the same functions used for all
the other formats.  VTK datasets defining scalars, vectors and tensors
on STRUCTURED_POINTS geometries can also be read and written.
