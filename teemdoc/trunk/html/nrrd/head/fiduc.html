<p>

Having cropped out images of the fiducials, we need a way of
differentiating the pixels inside and outside the fiducial markers, in
order to analyze how they move from slice to slice.  Since the markers
are gray, the the background is blue, the saturation of the pixel
color should be a good indicator.  "<tt>unu</tt>" doesn't know
anything about saturation or color, but it can compute the standard
deviation of the three color components.  More saturated colors will
have higher standard deviation.  Here are images of the standard
deviations of the the circle and I-beam images shown above:

<blockquote><pre>
unu project -i avf1130a.raw.Z.circle.ppm -a 0 -m sd \
  | unu quantize -b 8 | topng doc/<a href="circle-sd.png">circle-sd.png</a>
unu project -i avf1130a.raw.Z.ibeam.ppm -a 0 -m sd \
  | unu quantize -b 8 | topng doc/<a href="ibeam-sd.png">ibeam-sd.png</a>
</pre></blockquote>
<ul>

<li> <tt><a href="../../unrrdu/quantize.html">unu quantize</a>
... </tt> Takes integral and floating point data down to a smaller
number of bits.  By not explicitly specifying a min and max, the min
and max present in the input are mapped to 0 and 255, respectively.

</ul>

This looks very promising, and it certainly beats trying to do some
sort of segmentation!  It also demonstrates a benefit of <b>nrrd</b>'s
philosophy that "everything is a scalar".  That is, <b>nrrd</b> has no
notion of vector-valued sample values.  There is no such thing as a 3D
array of colors, there is only a 4D array of color components.  While
it might seem strange to make a seperate axis for color information,
since its not a spatial axis like X, Y, and Z, in this case it enabled
us to use one of <b>nrrd</b>'s many projection measures to collapse
the RGB color into a useful scalar.

<p>

Now we can produce what are essentially graphs of the fiducials' X and
Y positions, going through the 855 slices of the head:

<blockquote><pre>
unu join -i *<b>circle</b>.ppm -a 3 \
  | unu project -a 0 -m sd | unu project -a <b>1</b> -m min \
  | unu quantize -b 8 | unu resample -k box -s x2 = \
  | unu swap -a 0 1 | topng doc/<a href="circle-X.png">circle-X.png</a>

  | unu project -a 0 -m sd | unu project -a <b>1</b> -m min \

  | unu project -a 0 -m sd | unu project -a <b>0</b> -m min \
  | unu quantize -b 8 | unu resample -k box -s x2 = \
  | unu swap -a 0 1 | topng doc/<a href="circle-Y.png">circle-Y.png</a>
unu join -i *<b>ibeam</b>.ppm -a 3 \
  | unu project -a 0 -m sd | unu project -a <b>0</b> -m min \
  | unu quantize -b 8 | unu resample -k box -s x2 = \
  | unu swap -a 0 1 | topng doc/<a href="ibeam-Y.png">ibeam-Y.png</a>
</pre></blockquote>

There is some non-trivial <tt>unu</tt> cleverness going on here; each
step of the first command (ending with <tt>circle-X.png</tt>) is:
<ul>

<li> <tt><a href="../../unrrdu/join.html">unu join</a> ... </tt> This
collects all the PPM images into a volume, a 4-D array of color
values.  The "<tt>-a 3</tt>" flag says that the arrays are being
joined along axis 3, which doesn't exist in the input arrays, so
<tt>unu join</tt> knows that the output has one higher dimension.  The
axis ordering of the output of this step is (RGB,X,Y,Z).

<li> 1st <tt><a href="../../unrrdu/project.html">unu project</a>
... </tt> This projection along the color axis gives us an indicator
of being inside or outside the fiducial.  Projecting along an axis
removes it from the axis ordering, going from (RGB,X,Y,Z) to (X,Y,Z).

<li> 2nd <tt>unu project ... </tt> Now we want to project
along Y in order to get a picture of how the X position of the marker
changes as a function of Z.  Because Y is now the second axis, we
project along axis 1. We use the "<tt>-m min</tt>" measure because the
marker is darker than the background.  Again, projection removes an
axis from the ordering, so now the output ordering is (X,Z).  To
verify this, we can look at the labels of the output of this stage:
<blockquote><pre>
unu join -i *circle.ppm -a 3 \
  | unu project -a 0 -m sd | unu project -a 1 -m min \
  | unu head - | grep labels

labels: "X" ""
</pre></blockquote>

The label for the second axis (Z) is empty because we've never
specified one (and currently <tt>unu join</tt> doesn't have a way
of doing that).

<li> <tt><a href="../../unrrdu/quantize.html">unu quantize</a>
... </tt> The output of the first projection (standard dev of color)
was a floating point volume, and all subsequent steps have also
therefore been on floating point volumes.  At some point, however, we
need to get back to the world of fixed point.

<li> <tt><a href="../../unrrdu/resample.html">unu resample</a>
... </tt> This uses nearest-neighbor interpolation ("<tt>-k box</tt>")
to double the number of samples ("<tt>x2</tt>") along the first axis
(X), while leaving the second axis entirely untouched ("<tt>=</tt>").
This will have the effect of exaggerating any displacements between
slices.

<li> <tt><a href="../../unrrdu/swap.html">unu swap</a> ... </tt> The
input axis ordering is still (X,Z), which if put on screen would have
Z along the vertical, but we want to have these drawn on screen as a
more of a horizontal graph, with Z along the horizontal.  The easiest
way to do this is to just switch the axis ordering to (Z,X).  <b>Keep
in mind</b>, however, that when the data is shown in usual raster
order on a screen, the X values increase as you go <b>downward</b>,
not <b>upward</b>.  (If this was a problem, we could follow <tt>unu
swap</tt> with "<tt>unu flip -a 1</tt>".)

</ul>

What do these pictures tell us?  The motivation in making these
pictures was to see if there were sharp discontinuities.  There are
some, such as the shifts downward (toward higher X values) between Z
locations 88 and 89, 405 and 406, and 712 and 713, which are visible
to some extent in both the circle and I-beam X-versus-Z graphs.  But
these shifts are small, only about one pixel.  For now, we won't try
to correct for these; we'll make a volume dataset and then see if any
artifacts we notice can be plausibly associated with the displacements
measured by the graphs above.

<p>

The other thing to notice is that both markers moved in X and Y, and
more in Y than in X.  We can also see this in differences between
images near the top and bottom.  To improve image quality, we'll
average three images at each location.

<blockquote><pre>
unu join -i avf100{7,8,9}a.raw.Z.circle.ppm -a 3 \
  | unu project -a 0 -m sd | unu project -a 2 -m mean -o top.nrrd
unu join -i avf128{3,4,5}a.raw.Z.circle.ppm -a 3 \
  | unu project -a 0 -m sd | unu project -a 2 -m mean -o bot.nrrd
unu 2op - top.nrrd bot.nrrd \
  | unu quantize -b 8 | topng doc/<a href="diff-circle.png">diff-circle.png</a>
unu join -i avf100{7,8,9}a.raw.Z.ibeam.ppm -a 3 \
  | unu project -a 0 -m sd | unu project -a 2 -m mean -o top.nrrd
unu join -i avf128{3,4,5}a.raw.Z.ibeam.ppm -a 3 \
  | unu project -a 0 -m sd | unu project -a 2 -m mean -o bot.nrrd
unu 2op - top.nrrd bot.nrrd \
  | unu quantize -b 8 | topng doc/<a href="diff-ibeam.png">diff-ibeam.png</a>
</pre></blockquote>

<ul>

<li> 2nd <tt>unu project ... </tt> The axis ordering in the output
of the first projection is (X,Y,Z), so then projecting along axis 2
will eliminate Z, to give us (X,Y).  We measure the average with
"<tt>-m mean</tt>".  The order of projections here matters: taking
the standard deviation of the averages wouldn't be as useful.
We save the output of the projection as a floating point nrrd.

<li> <tt><a href="../../unrrdu/2op.html">unu 2op</a> ... </tt> A
number of unary, binary, and ternery arithmetic operations are
available on nrrds; this just does a component-wise difference between
the <tt>/tmp/top.nrrd</tt> and <tt>/tmp/bot.nrrd</tt>.

</ul>

Looking carefully at the circle and I-beam Y-versus-Z graphs, it seems
that I-beam moved downward <b>more</b> than the circle did, which
implies there was some small amount of rotatation, in addition to the
translation.  This seems to be a very small effect, so we won't worry
about it, but at least we had the means of detecting it.
