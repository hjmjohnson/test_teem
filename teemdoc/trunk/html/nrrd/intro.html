Nrrd is for representing and operating on N-dimensional raster data,
specifically, data sampled on a regular rectangular lattice.  This
means the grid has mutually orthogonal axes, and while the sample
spacing may vary between axes, it does not vary along any one axis.
Histograms, grayscale images, color images, and scalar volume data
like CT and MRI scans, are typical examples.  Rectilinear grids, with
mutually orthogonal axes but spatially varying sample spacing, are
represented in logical structure but not in geometry.  Curvilinear
grids, tetrahedral meshes, scattered point data, and polygonal data
are not supported, nor are multi-resolution grids.

<p>

In memory and on disk, the scanline ordering of the data on a regular
lattice imposes a strict linear ordering of all the samples.  A basic
capability of nrrd is managing the relationship between the
multi-dimensional logical structure of raster data, and its
one-dimensional physical layout.  There are three fundamental aspects
of this sort of data: the dimension of the grid, the different axes
for each dimension, and the type of data associated with each sample
point.  These three aspects are now considered in more detail.

<p>

Nrrd is intended to represent raster data of any dimension greater
than zero.  Ideally there would be no run-time limit on the
representable dimension.  The current implementation (the <b>nrrd</b>
library) has put a <tt>#define</tt> limit on the dimension;
<tt>NRRD_DIM_MAX</tt> is currently set to 16.  One subtle aspect of
dimension involves the handling of non-scalar data.  A simplifying
design decision in nrrd is essentially that "everything is a scalar".
Thus, in order to represent a 3-dimensional field of vectors, a
<b>4</b>-dimensional nrrd is used, usually with the (X,Y,Z) components
of the vector interleaved between sample points.  In this case, the
first axis has 3 samples, while the second, third, and fourth axes
correspond to the spatial dimensions of the grid.  "Everything is a
scalar" because the vector field is represented as a 4-D array of
scalars instead of a 3-D array of vectors.  In contrast, for scalar 3-D
data, the spatial dimensions are represented by the first, second, and
third axes of a 3-dimensional nrrd.  While it be seem strange to be
using nrrds of different dimensions for what is conceptually the same
grid, experience has shown that this is not a hinderance to using
nrrds to represent and operate on scalar, vector, and tensor data,
especially given the low-level flavor of the <b>nrrd</b> functions.

<p>

Having complete dimensional generality complicates the terms
"dimension" and "dimensions".  While "dimension" (singular) could be
used strictly to refer to the dimensionality of the grid itself (1 for
histograms, 2 for grayscale images, 3 for color images, etc.), and
"dimensions" (plural) could refer to the number of samples along the
axes, this seems risky.  In the context of nrrd, "dimension" is used
solely in in the former sense, and "size" is always used in the latter
sense.  Thus, an NTSC color image represented in nrrd would have
dimension 3, with sizes 3, 640, and 480.  The ordering of axes is
fundamental.  In nrrd, whenever the axes are represented or identified
in sequence, the ordering is always from "fastest" to "slowest".  If
we assign coordinates to each axis, and traverse the physical layout
of the raster data from the first sample (with all zero coordinates)
to the last sample, the fastest axis corresponds to that coordinate
which increments fastest as we traverse the samples.  Thus, nrrd's
axis ordering for typical color image data is color, horizontal, and
vertical.

<p>

What we call these axes is an entirely seperate issue of convention:
"X" could refer to the fastest or slowest spatial dimension.
Different schemes for creating multidimensional arrays in C/C++ have
different associated axes ordering.  Indexing data by
<tt>val[x][y][z]</tt>, for instance, implies that the X axis is
slowest.  On the other hand, if <tt>sx</tt> and <tt>sy</tt> are the
sizes of the X and Y axes, respectively, then indexing data by
<tt>*(val&nbsp;+&nbsp;x&nbsp;+&nbsp;sx*(y&nbsp;+&nbsp;sy*z))</tt>
implies that the X axis is fastest.  Nrrd is wholly agnostic on these
matters; it imposes or implies no policy on axis names or on indexing
methods.  Axes are identified in <b>nrrd</b> only by their integral
index into the axis ordering.  For the color data example mentioned
above, the color axis is 0, horizontal is 1, and vertical is 2.

<p>

There are many aspects of an axis that nrrd can represent.  The number
of samples is the only required information.  There is also a
dynamically allocated <tt>char*</tt> string which can be used to give
a name to each axis (but nrrd can't use the name to identify the
axis).  Whether the samples along an axis are cell or node centered
can also be indicated.  This plays an important role in representing
histograms (necessarily cell-centered) and image data (probably
cell-centered if you're talking about mipmaps, but node-centered in
many other signal-processing contexts).  The spacing between samples
is also represented, and if there is a known extent to the axis in
some "world" space, the min and max position of the axis can also be
represented.  Univariate histograms and joint histograms naturally
have a min and max along their axes; many volume datasets have only a
notion of spacing.

<p>

All this peripheral information describing each axis is saved to file
with <tt>nrrdSave()</tt> and <tt>nrrdWrite()</tt>.  Also, the axis
information follows each axis through all the basic <b>nrrd</b>
operations.  For example, if you have a volume with axis labels "x",
"y", and "z", and you use <tt>nrrdSlice()</tt> to cut the volume along
axis 0, the resulting 2-dimensional nrrd will have axis labels "y" and
"z".  If you use <tt>nrrdSpatialResample()</tt> to downsample a
640x480 cell-centered grayscale image, with spacings 1.0 and 1.0, to a
256x256 image, the resulting spacings will be 2.5 and 1.875 (but
2.50588 and 1.87843 if it was node-centered).  The proper and
intelligent handling of peripheral information, such as cell-vs-node
centering and axis-specific sample spacing, is the central difference
between "nearly raw" and "raw" raster data.  The absence of flexible
and powerful tools for operating on nearly raw raster data with
complete dimensional generality was the primary motivation for
starting <b>nrrd</b> development in 1998.  The rest of the <b>teem</b>
libraries grew out of <b>nrrd</b>.

<p>

Nrrd can handle ten different types of scalar data.  There are 8
integral types (1-, 2-, 4-, and 8-byte integers, signed and unsigned),
and two floating point types (4-byte floats, 8-byte doubles).  These
are currently implemented with the C types "<tt>char</tt>",
"<tt>short</tt>", "<tt>int</tt>", and "<tt>long long</tt>" (prefixed
by either "<tt>signed</tt>" or "<tt>unsigned</tt>"), and
"<tt>float</tt>" and "<tt>double</tt>".  Although "<tt>long
double</tt>" is available on many systems, it has no standard size (8
bytes on Mac OSX, 12 bytes on Intel, 16 bytes elsewhere), so it is not
included in nrrd.

<p>

The cautious and principled C/C++ programmer will quickly point out,
however, that <b>no</b> type can be counted on to have a specific
bit-size, according to the definition of the C language.  All we know
is that <tt>sizeof(char)</tt> is 1, but a <tt>char</tt> need not be 8
bits. Only the C99 language offers guaranteed bit-length
representation of types.  In spite of this, and to its pleasant
surprise, nrrd development actually has yet to encounter a machine on
which the types sizes listed above did not hold, or on which a byte
was not 8 bits.  Thus, the C types listed above are common in the
<b>nrrd</b> implementation across all platforms: GNU/Linux, Solaris (32
and 64 bit), and Irix (32 and 64 bit), Mac OSX, and Windows (which has
different names for the 8-byte integers).  As soon as one presents
itself, a machine with different underlying type sizes will provide
the opportunity and context for implementing and testing a system of
type abstraction which has, to date, not been required.

<p>

There is one final nrrd type, called "block".  This is actually not a
scalar, but an opaque chunk of memory of some specified length.  This
allows nrrd to represent and operate on, for example, a volume of C
structs or C++ objects, as long as they are all the same size.  Nrrd
can't determine a scalar value from a a block, nor can it create
blocks from scalar values, so it can't do operations like
histogramming or filtered resampling on arrays of blocks.  But many
other operations are supported, such as slicing, cropping, axis
permuting, and some kinds of padding.
