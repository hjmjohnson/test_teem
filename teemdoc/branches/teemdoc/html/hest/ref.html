<font size="+2"><b>Dependencies:</b></font><p>

<b>hest</b> depends on the <a href="../air/index.html"><b>air</b></a> library
for the <tt>airType</tt> enum, the <tt>airParseStr[]</tt> array of
parsing functions, the <tt>airStrtok()</tt> and <tt>airStrntok()</tt>
functions, and the <tt>airMop</tt> functionality (used for memory
management).

<hr noshade align=center width="70%">
<font size="+2"><b>Structs:</b></font><p>

The <tt>hestOpt</tt> struct is the important one:
the struct contains all the information and state used to deal with
identifying and parsing one command-line option. The last two members
of the struct are used by <tt>hestParse()</tt> for book-keeping,
and should be of no interest to <b>hest</b> users.

<pre>
<a name="hestOpt">typedef</a> struct {
  char *<i>flag</i>,           /* how the option is identified on the cmd line */
    *<i>name</i>;              /* simple description of option's parameter(s) */
  int <i>type</i>,             /* type of option (from airType enum) */
    <i>min</i>, <i>max</i>;           /* min and max # of parameters for option */
  void *<i>valueP</i>;         /* storage of parsed values */
  char *<i>dflt</i>,           /* default value written out as string */
    *<i>info</i>;              /* description to be printed with "glossary" info */
  int *<i>sawP</i>,            /* used ONLY for multiple variable parameter options
			   (min &lt max &gt; 2): storage of # of parsed values */

  /* --------------------- end of user-defined fields */

    <i>kind</i>,               /* what kind of option is this, based on min and max,
			   set by hestParse() (actually _hestPanic()),
			   later used by hestFree():
			   1: min == max == 0
			      a binary flag, no parameters
			   2: min == max == 1
                              one required parameter
			   3: min == max >= 2
                              multiple required parameters
			   4: min == 0; max == 1;
                              one optional parameter
			   5: max - min >= 1; max >= 2 
                              multiple optional parameter */
    <i>alloc</i>;              /* information about whether flag is non-NULL, and what

} hestOpt;
</pre>

All the <b>hest</b> functions which take a <tt>hestOpt*</tt> has one
of their arguments expect an array of these structs (and not an array
of pointers to the structs).  Such an array can be created statically
or dynamically, see <a href="usage1.html">usage basics</a>.  The
<b>hest</b> functions assume that the array is terminated by a struct
who's <tt><i>tag</i></tt> and <tt><i>name</i></tt> are both NULL, and
who's <tt><i>type</i></tt> is zero (not a valid type value in the
<tt>airType</tt> enum).
<p>

The <tt>hestParm</tt> struct contains various parameters affecting the
behavior of the <b>hest</b> functions, is the place for future
customizations and extra control.  If you are happy with the defaults,
you can always pass NULL instead of a <tt>hestParm</tt> pointer.
<pre>
<a name="hestParm">typedef</a> struct {
  int verbosity,        /* verbose diagnostic messages to stdout */
    respFileEnable,     /* whether or not to use response files */
    columns;            /* number of printable columns in output */
  char respFileFlag,    /* the character at the beginning of an argument
			   indicating that this is a response file name */
    respFileComment,    /* comment character for the repose files */
    varParamStopFlag;   /* prefixed by '-' to form the flag which signals
			   the end of a flagged variable parameter option
			   (single or multiple) */
} hestParm;
</pre>

<hr noshade align=center width="70%">
<a name="globals"><font size="+2"><b>Globals:</b></font></a><p>

These define the default behavior that you get by passing a NULL
<tt>hestParm</tt> to any of the <b>hest</b> functions.  When a
<tt>hestParmNew()</tt> creates a new <tt>hestParm</tt>, the fields are
initialized to the values shown below.  This is an extract from
the <tt>defaults.c</tt> file which defines these variables:
<pre>
int hestVerbosity = 0;
int hestRespFileEnable = AIR_FALSE;
int hestColumns = 80;
char hestRespFileFlag = '@';
char hestRespFileComment = '#';
char hestVarParamStopFlag = '-';
</pre>

Note that response files are not enabled by default.  The
<tt>hestColumns</tt> variable controls word wrap-around in the
printing that <tt>hestInfo()</tt>, <tt>hestUsage()</tt> and
<tt>hestGlossary</tt> do.  The <tt>hestRespFileFlag</tt> character
should be chosen to be a very very unlikely first character of any
unflagged parameters.  

<hr noshade align=center width="70%">
<font size="+2"><b>The Important Functions:</b></font><p>

<b>Note:</b> See the <a href="example.html">examples</a> page for
demonstrations of the output of the functions below for a variety
of different options.

<pre><b>
int <a name="hestParse">hestParse</a>(hestOpt *<i>opt</i>, int <i>argc</i>, char **<i>argv</i>,
              char **<i>errP</i>, hestParm *<i>parm</i>);
</b></pre>

<ul>

<li>The return value is 0 if there was no problem, and 1 if there was
a problem.

<li><tt><i>opt</i></tt> is an array of <a
href="#hestOpt"><tt>hestOpt</tt></a> structs, created by either of the
means illustrated in <a href="usage1.html">usage basics</a>.

<li><tt><i>argc</i></tt>, <tt><i>argv</i></tt> are the part of the
command line that <tt>hestParse()</tt> is supposed to make sense of.
For most programs, the executable name is in <tt>argv[0]</tt>,
so you would pass <tt><i>argc-1</i></tt>, <tt><i>argv+1</i></tt>
where <tt><i>argc</i></tt> and <tt><i>argv</i></tt> are the arguments
to your <tt>main()</tt> function.  <tt>hestParse()</tt> will <b>not</b>
alter the contents of these arrays, all the work it does are with
local copies.

<li><tt><i>errP</i></tt> is the address of a <tt>char*</tt>.  If there
is an error in parsing, <tt>hestParse()</tt> will set <tt>*errP</tt>
to the address of a newly allocated the error message.  If you pass
NULL, no error message is allocated, and you don't get to know what
went wrong.  If you do pass a non-NULL <tt><i>errP</i></tt> and there
is an error, it is your responsibility to <tt>free()</tt> the
resulting error message buffer.  <tt>hestParseFree()</tt> will not do
it for you.

<li><tt><i>parm</i></tt> is how you control behavior relating to how
parsing is done.  If all the defaults are just fine with you
(as seen in <a href="#globals">Globals</a> above), then you
just pass NULL.  Otherwise, you
create a <tt>hestParm</tt> with <a
href="#hestParmNew"><tt>hestParmNew()</tt></a>, and set the members as you
wish, before passing it to all the <b>hest</b> functions which take a
<tt>hestParm</tt>.  When you're done, delete it with <a
href="#hestParmFree"><tt>hestParmFree()</tt></a>.

</ul>

<pre><b>
void hestParseFree(hestOpt *<i>opt</i>);
</b></pre>

<ul>

<li> As described in <a href="usage2.html">usage details</a>,
<tt>hestParse()</tt> sometimes allocates memory in order to save the
values that are parsed from the command line.  If its important to you
to stay on top of each and every bit of dynamic memory allocation,
then you can call <tt>hestParseFree()</tt> to free all the memory that
<tt>hestParse()</tt> allocates.

<li> The information that is ultimately being passed to
<tt>free()</tt> is the <tt>valueP</tt> member of the <tt>hestOpt</tt>
struct, which generally is set to the address of some pointer variable
in the user's program.  <tt>hestParseFree()</tt> <u>will set the
pointer variable to NULL</u> to make sure no one accidentally uses
freed memory.

<li> Obviously, you need to pass to <tt>hestParseFree()</tt> the same
<tt><i>opt</i></tt> argument you've previously passed to
<tt>hestParse()</tt>.

</ul>

<pre><b>
void hestUsage(FILE *<i>file</i>, hestOpt *<i>opt</i>,
               char *<i>argv0</i>, hestParm *<i>parm</i>);
</b></pre>

<ul>

<li> The usage information is printed to the given <tt>FILE*</tt>;
<tt>stderr</tt> is a likely choice.  

<li> <tt><i>opt</i></tt> is as described above.

<li> <tt><i>argv0</i></tt> is a string containing the executable name
of the program for which you want the usage information.  This string
precedes all the identification of the options in the printed usage
line.

<li> <tt><i>parm</i></tt> is as described above.

<li> How an option is identified in the usage information is a little
complicated, but the basics are:
<ul>
<li> If the option is optional (since default information has been
supplied), then its identification is deliminated by square bracets.
<li> If the option is flagged, then the flag is printed at the beginning
of the identification
<li> The "name" of the option (the <tt>name</tt> member of the
<tt>hestOpt</tt> struct) appears in angle brackets.
</ul>

</ul>

<pre><b>
void hestGlossary(FILE *<i>file</i>, hestOpt *<i>opt</i>,
                  hestParm *<i>parm</i>);
</b></pre>

<ul>
<li> The glossary information is printed to the given <tt>FILE*</tt>;
<tt>stderr</tt> is a likely choice.  

<li> The role of the glossary information is to display the
<tt>info</tt> member of the <tt>hestOpt</tt> struct (a longer and more
detailed explanation of the option), to identify what information will
be parsed on the command line (how many parameters, and of what type),
and to indicate what the default values (if any) are for the option.

</ul>

<pre><b>
void hestInfo(FILE *<i>file</i>, char *<i>argv0</i>,
              char *<i>info</i>, hestParm *<i>parm</i>);
</b></pre>

<ul>

<li> Sometimes, in addition to the usage or glossary information, it
is nice to print a longer description of what a program does in
general.  <tt>hestInfo()</tt> simply prints that information, subject to
the word wrapping imposed by the number of columns.

<li> The general information is printed to the given <tt>FILE*</tt>;
<tt>stderr</tt> is a likely choice.

<li> <tt><i>argv0</i></tt> is a string containing the executable name
of the program for which you want the general information.

<li> <tt><i>info</i></tt> is a string containing the general information.

</ul>


<hr noshade align=center width="70%">
<font size="+2"><b>Utility Functions:</b></font><p>

<pre><b>
hestParm *hestParmNew();
hestParm *hestParmFree(hestParm *<i>parm</i>);
</b></pre>

<ul>

<li> These are the pseudo-constructors and destructors for the
<tt>hestParm</tt> struct

<li> The return value of <tt>hestParmNew()</tt> is the address of a
newly allocated and initialized <tt>hestParm</tt>, using the default
values set in <a href="#globals"><tt>defaults.c</tt></a>.

<li> The return value of <tt>hestParmFree()</tt> is NULL, to assist
in the avoidance of pointers to freed memory.

<li> Currently the <tt>hestParm</tt> has no dynamically allocated
elements, so these functions are currently slightly overkill.

</ul>

<pre><b>
void hestOptAdd(hestOpt **<i>optP</i>, char *<i>flag</i>, char *<i>name</i>,
                int <i>type</i>, int <i>min</i>, int <i>max</i>,
                void *<i>valueP</i>, char *<i>dflt</i>, char *<i>info</i>, ...);
</b></pre>

<ul>
<li> This is the function which is called repeatedly to build up an
array of <tt>hestOpt</tt> structs, to be passed on to the other
<b>hest</b> functions.

<li> The first argument to this is the address of a <tt>hestOpt</tt>
pointer.  You start building an option list by passing the address of
a pointer initialized to NULL.  With each call, a bigger array is
allocated and the old contents are copied over, so the value of
<tt>*optP</tt> may change after each call.  Maximally slick, fast, and
efficient?  No-- but who cares: we're just parsing a stupid command
line, and a single function to build the option list is nice to have.

<li> The next eight arguments are exactly the same as the first
eight members of the <tt>hestOpt</tt> struct.

<li> You should not try to mix static and dynamic <tt>hestOpt</tt>
array declarations.

<li> Notice that the last argument is a <tt>va_list</tt> variable
argument list.  This argument is <em>only</em> for multiple variable
parameter options (<tt>min</tt> &lt; <tt>max</tt>; <tt>max</tt> &gt;
1), and in this case it must be used.  As is shown in <a
href="usage1.html#hestOptAdd">usage basics</a>, pass the address of an
int for this argument, so that you can learn how many elements were
parsed on the command line.

<li> As is the general practice in <b>teem</b>, the strings arguments
to this function are <em>always</em> duplicated, so you need not
worry about the <tt>char*</tt>s in the <tt>hestOpt</tt> array pointing
to memory which you might want to free.

</ul>

<pre><b>
int hestOptCheck(hestOpt *<i>opt</i>, char **<i>errP</i>);
</b></pre>

<ul>

<li> This is how you check to make sure that you're <tt>hestOpt</tt>
array is well-defined.  This applies to <tt>hestOpt</tt> arrays
created either statically or dynamically.
<li> The return value is 0 if there are no problems, and 1 if there
are problems.
<li> If you pass the address of a <tt>char*</tt> as <tt>errP</tt>,
and there is an error, then <tt>hestOptCheck()</tt> will set <tt>*errP</tt>
to a newly allocated string containing the error message.  It is up
to you to free this string.  If there is no error, then <tt>*errP</tt>
is set to NULL.
<li> You can pass NULL as <tt>errP</tt>, but you won't know why the
<tt>hestOpt</tt> array is broken.  The return value of <tt>hestOptCheck()</tt>
is still a useful indicator.


</ul>

<pre><b>
hestOpt *hestOptFree(hestOpt *<i>opt</i>);
</b></pre>

<ul>

<li> This frees the <tt>hestOpt</tt> array that was created
dynamically by repeated calls to <tt>hestOptAdd()</tt>, and this also
frees the numerous strings that hang off the <tt>hestOpt</tt> struct.

<li> This is only for freeing a <tt>hestOpt</tt> array created
dynamically (with <tt>hestOptAdd()</tt>).
