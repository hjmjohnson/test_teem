To build <b>teem</b> you will need <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">GNU make</a>.  I am
in fact using many GNU-make-specific features, and all my makefiles
are actually named <tt>GNUmakefile</tt> instead of <tt>Makefile</tt>
to minimize the chances of someone trying to use a non-GNU make.

<ol>

<li> <a href="download/index.html">Download</a> the <b>teem</b>
distribution

<li> Untar it.<br>
Throughout this and all other <b>teem</b> documentation, the directory
just created will be referred to as "<tt>teem</tt>", even though it
will actually be called "<tt>teem-1.XblahN</tt>" or something similar.

<li> Go into this directory.

<li> Depending on what architecture you're on, set the <tt>TEEM_ARCH</tt>
environment variable (however you do that in your favorite shell) to
one of the following:

<ul>
<li><tt>linux</tt>: Any kind of GNU/Linux
<li><tt>cygwin</tt>: A Cygwin shell running on a Windows box
<li><tt>irix6.n32</tt>: 32-bit Irix
<li><tt>irix6.64</tt>: 64-bit Irix
<li><tt>solaris</tt>: Solaris machines running in 32-bit mode.
<li><tt>darwin</tt>: A Mac running OS X (which runs on top of
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/darwin/">Darwin</a>).
</ul>

<li> <tt>cd src; make</tt><br>
This will build and "install" all the <b>teem</b> libraries, as well
as all the <a href="bin/index.html">command-line tools</a>.  This
build will take a little while.  On a multi-processor machine,
building <tt>teem-1.5betaX</tt> or later, feel free to use
"<tt>make&nbsp;-j10</tt>" or similar to speed this up.  NOTE: This
isn't an "install" in the traditional Unix build sense, since no files
will be created outside the top-level <tt>teem</tt> directory.
Headers are put in <tt>teem/include</tt>, libraries are created in
<tt>teem/&lt;arch&gt;/lib</tt>, and the command-line tools in
<tt>teem/&lt;arch&gt;/bin</tt>, where "<tt>&lt;arch&gt;</tt>" is the
same as what you set <tt>TEEM_ARCH</tt> to.

<li> <tt>cd ../&lt;arch&gt;/bin</tt>

<li> <tt>./nrrdSanity</tt><br>

This little program calls a <b>nrrd</b> function called
<tt>nrrdSanity()</tt> which basically makes sure that everything
hard-coded (or set at compile-time) into <b>nrrd</b> is correct for
the machine you're on.  For instance, the various assumptions about
type sizes and representational ranges are checked, as is endianness,
and the availability of IEEE 754 floating point numbers.  If you get
anything besides:

<blockquote><pre>
./nrrdSanity: nrrd sanity check passed.
</pre></blockquote>

then your <b>teem</b> build will not work correctly.  Either one of
the default settings in the architecture-specific makefile
<tt>teem/src/make/&lt;arch&gt;.mk</tt> is wrong, or your machine isn't
up to snuff.  In either case, email me (gk@cs.utah.edu) with the error
message from <tt>nrrdSanity</tt>.

</ol>

If you'd rather everything be installed to some other directory (with
include, lib, and bin subdirectories), then set environment variable
<tt>TEEM_DEST</tt> to that directory, and make will put headers,
libraries, and binaries in the corresponding subdirectories of
<tt>TEEM_DEST</tt>.

<p>

If interested, you can read more about the <a
href="tree/index.html">directory structure of <b>teem</b></a>.  For
more specific information about how the GNUmakefiles work, or how to
use them to do something besides the standard install described above,
see <a href="gmake/index.html">How <b>teem</b> uses GNU make</a>.
