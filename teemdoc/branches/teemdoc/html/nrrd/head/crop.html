    <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Cropping</b></h2>
</table>
<p>

Supposing that we'd like to crop the slices so to only contain the
head, we need to know where to crop.  We can project through a small
subset of the slices in order to see where the "footprint" of the head
is, within the frame of the color images.  One kind of projection
which should work is simply maximum intensity projection, since any
tissue will be brighter in red and green than the blue surrounding
material.  The subset of slices we'll use is <tt>*{0,5}a.raw.Z</tt>
(every 15th slice), but only up to <tt>avf1215a</tt>, since that is
where the shoulders begin:

<blockquote><pre>
ls -1 data/avf11?{0,5}a.raw.Z data/avf12{0,1}{0,5}a.raw.Z | wc -l
            24
</pre></blockquote>

Knowing that the number of slices to project through is 24,
we can now create the color volume and project it:

<blockquote><pre>
zcat data/avf11?{0,5}a.raw.Z data/avf12{0,1}{0,5}a.raw.Z \
  | unu make -i - -t uchar -s 2048 1216 3 24 -e raw \
  | unu project -a 3 -m max \
  | unu permute -p 2 0 1 -o headmax.ppm
</pre></blockquote>

<ul>

<li> <tt><a href="../../unrrdu/make.html">unu make</a> ... </tt>
Running <tt>zcat</tt> on a sequence of files (each of which is an
image for a different Z coordinate) will generate raw data in which
the Z coordinate changes the slowest.  Since the axis ordering for one
image is (X,Y,RGB), the axis ordering for the <tt>zcat</tt> output
should be (X,Y,RGB,Z), so the axis sizes given to "<tt>-s</tt>" are in
that order.

<li> <tt><a href="../../unrrdu/project.html">unu project</a> ... </tt>
Projecting along the Z axis means that the Z axis is eliminated from
the volume. The dimension is decreased by one, and the axis ordering
of the output is (X,Y,RGB). Each scaline along Z is replaced by a
single scalar which measures some aspect of the scanline.  We're using
maximum intensity projection: "<tt>-m max</tt>".

<li> <tt><a href="../../unrrdu/permute.html">unu permute</a> ... </tt>
The output of projection has to be axis permuted just like an
individual slice.

</ul>

<p>

The resulting image (headmax.ppm) is as big as one of the slices;
here's a downsampled version:
<blockquote><pre>
unu resample -i headmax.ppm -s = x0.3 x0.3 | topng doc/<a href="headmaxsm.png">headmaxsm.png</a>
</pre></blockquote>

<center>
<img width=614 height=364 alt="" src="headmaxsm.png">
</center>

<p>

By inspecting this image, a bound on the head was found with the
help of <tt>xv</tt> (middle button gives pixel coordinates):

<blockquote><pre>
unu crop -i headmax.ppm -min 0 771 271 -max M 1319 945 \
  | unu resample -k cubic:0,0.5 -s = x0.5 x0.5 \
  | topng doc/<a href="headmaxcrop.png">headmaxcrop.png</a>
</pre></blockquote>
<ul>

<li> <tt><a href="../../unrrdu/crop.html">unu crop</a> ... </tt> This
selects a sub-array from the input, bounded by the coordinates given
to "<tt>-min</tt>" and "<tt>-max</tt>".  "<tt>M</tt>" means "highest
coordinate along this axis".

</ul>
<center>
<img alt="" width=274 height337 src="headmaxcrop.png">
</center>

<p>

Besides cropping down to the head, we would also like to see if there
are any problems with spatial displacements between the images, which
would create sharp edges in the data where none existed in the tissue.
This is facilitated with the fiducial markers which appear in every
slice.  Inspection of individual slices (with the commands <a
href="inspect.html">shown earlier</a>) determined 80x80 pixel windows
which bound the circle marker, and the I-beam marker on the opposite
side of the slice.  Here they are for slice <tt>avf1130a</tt>:

<blockquote><pre>
zcat data/avf1130a.raw.Z \
  | unu make -i - -t uchar -s 2048 1216 3 -e raw \
  | unu permute -p 2 0 1 -o tmp.ppm
unu crop -i tmp.ppm -min 0 365 945 -max M m+79 m+79 \
  | topng doc/<a href="circle.png">circle.png</a>
unu crop -i tmp.ppm -min 0 1660 950 -max M m+79 m+79 \
  | topng doc/<a href="ibeam.png">ibeam.png</a>
</pre></blockquote>

Having identified the region for the head and markers in each image,
we go through all 855 slices and save out these regions as PPMs.
We also save a half-size version of the head images, as these will
be easier to handle in a later processing step.

<blockquote><pre>
foreach SLC ( `(cd data; echo avf*.raw.Z)` )
  echo $SLC
  zcat data/$SLC \
     | unu make -i - -t uchar -s 2048 1216 3 -l X Y RGB -e raw \
     | unu permute -p 2 0 1 -o tmp.ppm
  unu crop -i tmp.ppm -min 0 365 945 -max M m+79 m+79 -o $SLC.circle.ppm
  unu crop -i tmp.ppm -min 0 1660 950 -max M m+79 m+79 -o $SLC.ibeam.ppm
  unu crop -i tmp.ppm -min 0 771 271 -max M 1319 945 -o $SLC.head.ppm
  unu resample -i $SLC.head.ppm -k tent -s = x0.5 x0.5 -o $SLC.headsm.ppm
end
</pre></blockquote>

<ul>

<li> <tt><a href="../../unrrdu/make.html">unu make</a> ... </tt> The
only new thing here is the use of the "<tt>-l</tt>" option to give a
"label" for each axis.  Axis labels are short descriptive strings
which follow the axis through various <b>nrrd</b> transformations.
These will be used below to keep track of which axes are which.

</ul>

Go grab lunch will this runs, it can take over an hour, a significant
part of which is simply running <tt>zcat</tt> over and over.

<p>

One useful aspect of the NRRD writer is that when it writes PPM
images, it stores information for the NRRD headers in PPM comments.
Since the NRRD file format can contain <a
href="../format.html#sect4">many different fields</a>, its handy to
have them stored in non-NRRD files.  It is easy to read these headers,
too.  Instead of using <tt>head</tt> to look at the PPM header (and
risk clobbering your terminal settings with bizarro binary data), use
<tt>unu head</tt>:

<blockquote><pre>
unu save -i avf1130a.raw.Z.head.ppm -f nrrd | unu head -

NRRD0001
content: crop(permute(???,2,0,1),[0,2]x[771,1319]x[271,945])
type: unsigned char
dimension: 3
sizes: 3 549 675
labels: "RGB" "X" "Y"
encoding: raw
</pre></blockquote>

The <tt>content</tt> field shows that this image is the result of
permuting and then cropping some original array, and there is enough
information here to recreate the result.  The <tt>labels</tt> field
shows what became of the information originally given to <tt>unu
make</tt>'s "<tt>-l</tt>" option.
